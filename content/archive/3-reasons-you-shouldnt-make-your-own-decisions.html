<p><a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/deciding.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3183" alt="deciding" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/deciding-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>I was recently looking for a good meal replacement option to make sure I get enough calories and protein on days when I don't have the time to prepare a good meal. While this may seem like a non-issue, I've made a commitment to only eating whole foods, so it's a bit trickier than it seems. I know how to make this decision, because I've done it before and I'm certainly qualified, as a person who knows what's best for himself and as a trainer with a lot of experience dealing with nutrition. Yet, despite all that, my first inclination was to ask around with my trainer buddies, to check Paleo/Primal blogs, and to put the question to Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Even with the knowledge that I would make the best decision for myself without any input, I still wanted someone else to make the decision for me.</strong></p>
<p>Because I'm the kind of person that <a title="Insecurity, the Root of All Evil" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/">questions my thinking</a> process (in case you haven't picked up on that by now), I wanted to figure out why I felt the need to ask around. After all, I have rarely asked for input on what I should be doing for my own training. Ask 50 trainers what you should be doing and you'll get 50 different answers; it's really something you need to decide for yourself. Once you've done that, then find a trainer who can help you reach that goal. I find it's better to make my own decisions and my own mistakes.</p>
<p>I'm not saying outside input isn't valuable. When you want to learn something, definitely seek out qualified teachers. I saw that Gold Medal Bodies was teaching a lot of people to do previously unattainable gymnastics skills, so I got <a title="Review of Gold Medal Bodies Floor 1 Training Program" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/review-of-gold-medal-bodies-floor-1-training-program/">one of their programs</a>. But when you're making a decision, you already have all the information you need, and you know yourself well enough to know what's good for you, then asking for additional input is just pushing it off.</p>
<p>So, why was I hesitating and looking for outside opinions? I came up with a few answers.<!--more--></p>
<h3>Mental laziness</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that it doesn't involve much visible effort, thinking is hard work. <strong>Many of us tend towards mental laziness simply because thinking through all the possibilities and alternatives to a decision requires a lot of time, and doing it well requires us to actually insist on a high quality, valid answer, rather than simply a convenient one</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn't want to go through the full process of researching the protein shakes on the market, assessing which one met my needs (which would first require that I specifically define my needs), do a cost comparison, figure out which was the least processed, weighting whether I should go with a plant source or an animal source, consider alternatives, etc. So I thought, maybe some source I trust has already done all the legwork for me.</p>
<p>Of course, I realized that there are several sources I trust that would have done all that, but not all of them would agree with each other. Some might even say that protein shakes were a bad option no matter what. Which brings me to my second reason:</p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we've already settled on what we want the answer to be. If you hate weights, you could easily validate a decision to do nothing but cardio. All it would take is hanging around the right kinds of blogs. In fact, you'd even pick up a number of great counterarguments to anyone who might suggest your aching back could benefit from some deadlifts instead of added miles and more stretching. Online especially, we tend to stick to our communities and viewpoints: you follow people you like on social media, and so most of the articles you read agree with your viewpoints. <strong>For a lot of people, social media becomes a sort of echo chamber. We get to feel right about everything, but we're missing half the picture</strong>.</p>
<p>I wanted a protein shake because it seemed like the easiest solution to busy days. That was clear, and I didn't need someone to explain that. However, I wanted someone else to tell me it was okay. I had already made the decision to get one, and any research I did would be to simply validate my decision, assure me that someone else also thought it was a good idea. So if it turned out to not be, I could just shrug and blame them.</p>
<h3>Avoidance of Responsibility</h3>
<p>It's weird, but most of us try to avoid responsibility for things, even our own health and fitness. We want someone else to tell us what to do. Often, this is because we don't want to be blamed if things don't work out. If your trainer prescribes a particular workout and it doesn't get you the right results, you can just switch trainers without having to admit that you didn't even put in the effort (or you could simply say that your ex-trainer couldn't motivate you/gave you a workout that was too difficult, etc). Even if you're training yourself, you can always blame whatever program you're following, or life circumstances, or your genetics, or whatever. <strong>As long as it isn't your fault.</strong></p>
<h3>Haven't We Been This Way?</h3>
<p>I wanted someone else to make the decision for me because, well, I've said before that I don't really like processed foods, even those that are "Beyond Organic." If I could just find some respected Paleo/Primal-friendly trainer out there saying, "Hey, if you don't have enough time to eat, just have a protein shake. It's better than starving," I could let them make the call on whether or not I should break my whole-foods-only diet.</p>
<p>I am familiar enough with the various trends within the fitness and nutrition community to imagine all the answers I'd get. I knew I was just trying to get out of making a decision myself.</p>
<p>So I went to the store, looked at the various brands, compared their ingredients and their prices and bought...8 cans of sardines. 30 grams of protein, easy to carry and zero prep (just eat out of the can), loads of Omega-3s, calcium, and phosphorus, sustainably fished, and cheaper per gram of protein than the shakes. Plus, it's a whole food.</p>
<p>Ironically, that's what I'd been doing before I moved to Boulder, because, as I said, I've encountered this dilemma before.</p>
<h3>The Lesson</h3>
<p><strong>When it comes to health and fitness, there's very little new under the sun. <a title="Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/">Learn the principles</a>, see how respected trainers and athletes apply them, and make your own decisions, based on your own needs in the particular circumstances of your own health and fitness goals.</strong></p>
<p>And if you don't feel that you're experienced enough to do that, understand that experience comes from putting in the mental effort to test your ideas, taking on responsibility so you actually get the chance to try things, and validating your trials against the real world, not other peoples' opinions.</p>
