excerpt: Unleashing the passion and potential of my generation.
---
<p>We are the Millennials. Constantly connected, over-educated, and fired with passion, we have been accused of laziness, entitlement, and narcissism.</p>
<p>But we are to inherit the world, a world that is more and more defined by change: entire business platforms rise and fall in the course of a few months. I have no doubt that history repeats itself, but with over 7 billion people, nations with the power to manufacture unfathomable quantities of goods, and an information network that rivals the human brain, I feel justified in saying <strong>the world we inherit will be unique in human history</strong>.</p>
<h3>A Brave New World</h3>
<p>Despite all the negative adjectives thrown our way, one thing I have seen among my peers is a truly inspiring degree of passion, a desire to remake the world, to set their own rules and live by their own principles.</p>
<p>We have a powerful vision of a world far different than the one we were born into. Many of us have become distrustful of established power structures. We have seen the green revolution co-opted by corporate interests. Growing up in a globalized world has revealed to us that we cannot blindly pursue power without thought for the repercussions on the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is vulnerable to questioning now</strong>, and so many of my friends are unsatisfied with what life has given them.</p>
<p>And lets be honest, life hasn't give them much. Youth unemployment in the US ranges from 20%-30% (depending on the study and the criteria), an abysmally high number. We are underemployed, not unemployable. We came of age into a world that didn't have a place for us, that couldn't utilize us, that expects us to wait idly on the sidelines and be grateful for placeholders like internships and volunteerism.</p>
<p>That, right there, that's the sense of entitlement we're accused of. But shall we instead deign to accept meager returns? <strong>I think it's better to constantly be chafing at the bit, <a title="Grow to Live: Why Constant Improvement is Necessary" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/grow-to-live-why-constant-improvement-is-necessary/">striving for more</a> and the chance to make an impact.</strong></p>
<p>In a way, Warrior Spirit is a blog for millennials: it admits a sense of higher purpose, the right to excellence, and even the <a title="Are You in the 1%? You Should Be" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/">responsibility to be great</a>. At the same time, it asserts the importance of getting your hands dirty, doing the nitty-gritty, and having the pragmatic know-how to make our vision of the world a reality.<!--more--></p>
<h3>Pragmatic Idealism</h3>
<p>With high aspirations often come painful disappointments, especially when you realize how much work actually goes into realizing your dreams. Luckily, my peers and I are fully aware of the massive effort required to overcome the inertia of this world.</p>
<p><a title="Why Passion Isn’t Enough" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/passion-vs-skill/">We know that passion is not enough</a><a title="Why Passion Isn’t Enough" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/passion-vs-skill/">.</a></p>
<p>Despite this, we are still willing to be idealistic.</p>
<p>In his book, <em>Fast Future, </em>David Burstein described Millennials' approach to social change as pragmatic idealism: "a deep desire to make the world a better place combined with an understanding that doing so requires building new institutions while working inside and outside existing institutions."</p>
<p>Pragmatic idealism is that unique combination of dreaming big while staying realistic about your abilities. You know your odds of getting on the New York Times bestseller list, but instead of deterring you, it simply informs your efforts. I don't think there's anything wrong with trying to be everything, as long as you are realistic about how far you can get and how hard you must work.</p>
<p>Part of being well-rounded is being adaptable. Instead of choosing between renouncing the world and totally buying in, I believe in mastering what's necessary. It's silly to <a title="Do You Trade Happiness to Live ‘Right?’: Claim Your Light" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/do-you-trade-happiness-to-live-right-claim-your-light/">shoot yourself in the foot by denying the way things are</a>, just because you think they ought to be different.</p>
<h3>High expectations</h3>
<p>I really do believe that we should have high expectations. The more I've learned about life, the more it has become clear that <a title="The World is What You Make It, So Make It Good" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-world-is-what-you-make-it-so-make-it-good/">you get what you believe you deserve</a>, and if you can't allow yourself to feel deserving of success, prosperity, healthy relationships, responsibility, and all the other good things life has to offer, you're much less likely to actually attain those things.</p>
<p>So when Millennials are accused to demanding too much, or expecting too much, I ask if the alternatives are more desirable. The accusers might say that the degree of change we demand is unrealistic, but I say aim high while keeping in mind you might not get there soon, or at all, and that plans should be adaptable.</p>
<p>When I started Warrior Spirit, I wanted to find a balance between my desire to change the world and my desire to achieve mastery of the world I lived in. I want to be spiritually sensitive and financially savvy, technologically literate and physically developed. I don't think those things are necessarily mutually exclusive, but there is a reason being well-rounded is respected and rare: it is hard.</p>
<p>I know I can't be everything, but as long as I don't ignore my strengths for the sake of <a title="6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/">my shortcomings</a>, maintain perspective, and stay <a title="Empower Yourself Through Humility" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empower-yourself-through-humility/">humble</a>, aspiring to more is only going to push me to accomplish more.</p>
<p><strong>I would rather live in a world full of limitless possibility, even if I never attain them, than in one with confining limits. I choose to believe in that first world, knowing that belief and action go hand in hand.</strong></p>
<h3>To Replace or to Change</h3>
<p>One of the most influential articles I've read this year was <a title="Brian Sowards" href="http://briansowards.com/dont-change-the-world-create-it/" target="_blank">this one</a> by Brian Sowards. In it, he argues that our generation isn't out to simply change the world. Instead, he wants to create it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I no longer aspire to change the world. What I aspire to do is bring together a group of people who are signed up to live in a much better one, and simply start living it. - Brian Sowards</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked how he plans to compete with a big, well-established corporation, he responds by saying <strong>he doesn't intend to compete with them at all; he intends to replace them.</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a brilliant way to reframe the questions that we have been bombarded with since high school: What do you want to study? Where do you want to go to school? What company do you want to work for?</p>
<p><strong>What place will you fill in this world?</strong></p>
<p>This question contains a limiting presupposition: the only way to live is to fill a spot provided and predefined.</p>
<p>I never really wanted to grow up into the world I saw around me. I didn't see any alternatives, but given the choice, I would have asked for something different entirely. What Sowards' article does brilliantly is remind us that life is not a multiple choice test. If you don't like the answers presented to you, you can write in your own.</p>
<h3>The Millennial Problem</h3>
<p>Of course, this is much, much harder, and I think this fact speaks to the frustration my peers and I feel: we know the system is broken, largely because people created and followed the very same choices we are now presented with, so we know those aren't the answers. But we don't always realize that there are other choices. Remember, we were raised in a society that had protocols, procedures, and processes for everything. That was a symptom of the post-WWII era in general, but as technology came to dominate our world, much of life has been fitted into tidy lines. We have been so acclimatized to <a title="Velvet Ropes" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/velvet-ropes/" target="_blank">the lines</a>, we don't always realize we're staying within them.</p>
<p>I believe that this the greatest challenge my generation faces: <a title="Do You Trade Happiness to Live ‘Right?’: Claim Your Light" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/do-you-trade-happiness-to-live-right-claim-your-light/" target="_blank">claiming our own power and agency</a>. We have the skills, the passion, and the connections to make great things happen. We just need to realize that we are allowed to, that we can step outside the lines, make changes, dig up established traditions and remake them.</p>
<p>I'm not saying many of my peers don't already do this. But many of us find ourselves <a title="When Life Gets in the Way, What do You Do?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/when-life-gets-in-the-way-what-do-you-do/">running up against an invisible wall</a> constructed by our particular perceptions of 'how things work'. Older generations scold our lack of initiative and our apparent expectation of being shown through, but the wall is very real to us. It can only be dismantled through a change in perception, which is exactly what I try to advocate on this blog: Pay attention to the ways you think and cultivate those that empower you.</p>
