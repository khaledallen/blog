<p>I have come to the realization that I am a weird dude.  Furthermore, I have finally accepted that I am one of the weirdest  people I know.</p>
<p>For a while, I was holding out that I just had a few  eccentricities related to my exercise and dietary habits. After a while,  though, these things started to impact other areas of my life, and the  weirdness started to grow. An interest in barefoot running turned into a  general refusal to wear shoes. A concern with healthy food led to  eating raw meat. It became very hard to deny that I’m just strange.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Fringe Normal</strong></p>
<p>I had been telling myself that I was only engaging in  these activities to the extent that they were useful, but unlike those  other crazies who were more involved, I was pretty normal.</p>
<p>Well, after running my first barefoot race and a few  incidences of me flailing like a madman through the forest, I’ve had to  accept that I finally crossed over into truly odd.</p>
<p>And now that I have accepted this fact about myself, I feel much more at ease.</p>
<p>You see, I had been holding back my oddities. I kept  having the urge to take the next step in my stranger hobbies, but I  worried that if I did, then I’d be really crossing the line, and after  all, I was still a normal person who didn’t do those things.</p>
<p>Well, after accepting that I’m just one of those strange  people, it has been a lot easier to be strange in public. Which of  course means that I can practice my weird hobbies with more gusto.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Weirdness</strong></p>
<p>I think that everyone is secretly pretty weird. We might  have a strange sense of humor, unusual interests or hobbies  (needlepoint-loving football players, eg), or a devotion to niche movie  genres. Very often we hold back, only revealing these aspects of  ourselves to our trusted confidants. But how much more free would be  feel if we could be comfortable with our weirdness all the time? Or even  be proud of it?</p>
<p>Normal people freak me out. I met a normal person once.  She did very well in school, was going into corporate business, was part  of a sorority, enjoyed normal TV shows and had no fashion  eccentricities. She also had an all-American boyfriend. She was always  smiling and friendly. All of this was very creepy. I felt like I was  talking with a robot most of the time. There was also a subtle undertone  of low-grade stress, like keeping up the appearance of excellent  normalcy was taking its toll.</p>
<p>So don’t even try to be normal! It’s stressful and bad for  your health. Plus, you’ll have more fun if you just do the things you  love and dress in your own, ‘unique’ style, as you are inclined.</p>
<p><strong>Stay weird,</strong></p>
