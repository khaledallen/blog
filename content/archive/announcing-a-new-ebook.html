    all my excellent readers. I’m sure you’ve been dying for details since then (or
    maybe not).\r\n\r\nBasically, I’m putting together a collection of ‘Spirit Quest’
    stories from some of my friends who are living inspiring lives. It occurred to
    me that having examples of inspiration might provide some extra push for my readers
    who are trying to figure life out (that would be everyone, I guess)."

<p>I mentioned last week that I was working on an eBook for  all my excellent readers. I’m sure you’ve been dying for details since  then (or maybe not).</p>
<p>Basically, I’m putting together a collection of ‘Spirit  Quest’ stories from some of my friends who are living inspiring lives.  It occurred to me that having examples of inspiration might provide some  extra push for my readers who are trying to figure life out (that would  be everyone, I guess).<!--more--></p>
<p>Really, I just wanted to get my friends and readers involved, so I put out an invitation to contribute. I have the good fortune to know some very inspirational, amazing individuals, so I asked them to write a few stories to share.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know all the amazing, courageous people out there, so I am also inviting anyone else who is interested to  contribute a story. The format is basically that of a story about some  significant event in your life that helped you choose your path, make  headway on a path you’d already chosen, or grow as a person.</p>
<p>The model I’m aiming for is along the lines of a  traditional Spirit Quest, which was a journey that young warriors would  have to undertake before they could become adults. In some cultures,  this Spirit Quest was a physical journey, and in others it took place in  a dream or through some sort of ritual.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute, just think of an event in  your life that challenged you and forced you out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can e-mail me at <strong><em>warrior (at) khaledallen (dot) com</em></strong>. I will send you more detailed guidelines.</p>
<p>The book will be free. It’s just a gift I’m putting  together for my friends and readers. In return, you’ll get a link in the  eBook if you want it, and you may of course publish your work  anonymously.</p>
<p><strong>I look forward to hearing all your stories!</strong></p>
