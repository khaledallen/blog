<p>Are you having fun?</p>
<p>I don't mean bounce-off-the-walls giddy. Nor do I mean partying until 3am every day.</p>
<p><strong>But basically, do you enjoy your days? Do you get a kick out of your schedule? Do you have something interesting and new to excite you planned every day?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want to get out of bed every morning?</p>
<p>A lot of my friends do not. When they were in college, there was something new every single day. Sure it was really hard work, but between academic challenges, an active social life, and all sorts of clubs and get-togethers, most of my peers had a pretty fun college experience.</p>
<p>After college, we all signed up for tedious and repetitive day jobs with respectable companies. Some of my friends still have fun, as their jobs apparently require that they party until 3am in Las Vegas.... No names will be mentioned. The rest of us, however, have settled into a distinctly un-fun routine.</p>
<p>We drag ourselves out of bed, make coffee, get ourselves to work, sit at a desk for 8-12 hours, come home, eat dinner, watch TV, and go to bed. We do that every day.</p>
<p>And it's not that this can't be fun. You can take joy in your cup-o-joe, and maybe you have an interesting a varied job. Maybe dinner is made from scratch every night with ingredients you get to hand pick from your local farmers market.</p>
<p>However, my experience is that this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>But it could be.</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of grocery shopping, but I get a kick out of going to farmers markets. For me, that makes it a lot of fun to prepare long and involved meals.</p>
<p>I'm also not a huge fan of exercise, but when I 'pretend' I'm training to become a superhero or a ninja, it injects a new sense of purpose and FUN into the whole process. At first, it was just a label, but soon I started actually finding ways to make my workouts more authentic, taking training ideas from old Kung Fu movies.</p>
<p>I usually go barefoot, but when I put shoes on, I first have to wiggle my toes into my special toe socks. I personally get a kick out of this routine. It's weird and very rarely do I have to pay so much attention to my toes, so it mixes things up.</p>
<p>It's just little things like that which can make your days more enjoyable and smile-worthy.</p>
<p>And if you just can't make your days fun, consider that you might need to change what it is you're doing with your limited time on this Earth.</p>
<p>But more commonly, it's just a matter of perspective, like everything else in life.</p>
