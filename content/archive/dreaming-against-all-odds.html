  _aioseop_description: he speaker above is legally blind, and yet she dreamed about
    being a racecar driver. That didn’t work out, but she did ride an elephant across
    India and was a very high powered executive for a number of years. She never let
    her eyesight slow her down or lower her expectations for herself. And she certainly
    never let anyone else’s idea of what she should be able to do determine what she
    aimed for.

<p>The speaker above is legally blind, and yet she dreamed  about being a racecar driver. That didn’t work out, but she did ride an  elephant across India and was a very high powered executive for a number  of years. She never let her eyesight slow her down or lower her  expectations for herself. And she certainly never let anyone else’s idea  of what she should be able to do determine what she aimed for.<!--more--></p>
<p>Hers was an extreme case, but I think we all experience a bit of that attitude: “You can’t do that because of X.”</p>
<p>In my case, I couldn’t be a writer because it didn’t pay  well. I couldn’t be a gymnast because I’d started too late. I couldn’t  approach girls because I was too scared. Never mind hard work to  overcome obstacles. The obstacles are there, so better to just respect  them and try for something else.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the obstacles are so huge that nobody has ever  tried to get around them. Of course, in that case, you’ve actually got  things easier. If nobody has ever tried what you want to do, how can  anyone legitimately say it cannot be done?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the obstacles are seemingly insurmountable. A  blind racecar driver just doesn’t make sense. Maybe not, but that  doesn’t mean you can’t dream about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the point of dreaming isn’t to actually get you  somewhere, but instead to dare to dream. Sometimes, it’s more about  having the courage to be so bold.</p>
<p>You may not get exactly what you dream of, but having the  conviction to be yourself and follow your vision of your life despite  all rational notions to the contrary gives you the strength to pursue  anything else you might want to.</p>
<p><strong>The real challenge of dreaming is internal, and  consists of convincing yourself that you are worthy and capable, that  you are good enough and strong enough.</strong></p>
<p>So yeah, maybe your dreams are ridiculous and impossible.  But so what? If you honestly believe you can make them happen, you  understand the true meaning of faith and courage.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading! I’d love to hear your crazy dreams. Please share in the comments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dream on, Brave Warriors!</strong></p>
