<p>I say that you do not recognize before you and around you  any but those office-holders whole commissions have been signed by a  minister or a king; and that the men whom God has put above these  office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow  out instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your narrow,  limited field of observation. - The Count of Monte Cristo</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the usual question we ask kids—“What do you want  to be when you grow up?”—is the wrong sort of question. Instead, we  should be asking them, “What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>As the Count of Monte Cristo points out in the above  quotation, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who fill  posts and those who pursue missions. The two are not always mutually  exclusive, but they are usually very separate ideas.</p>
<p><strong>To me, the difference seems to be that a post is limiting while a mission is empowering.<!--more--></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Filling a Post</strong></h2>
<p>When you fill a post, your abilities and resources are  limited by the assumed authority of responsibility of the post. You do  gain all of its powers, but you cannot apply those powers outside of  your set jurisdiction. You are constrained and defined by your role. You  cannot act beyond of outside it.</p>
<h2><strong>Pursuing a Mission</strong></h2>
<p>A mission, on the other hand, gives you the ability to do  or become whatever is necessary to see its completion. “Here is the  desired outcome, now make it happen!” You may fill various posts along  the way, but your conception of your capabilities is ever limited by the  bounds of what role you are currently playing. Like an actor who  changes costumes to suit the desired effect on the audience, you may be  one thing at one stage of your mission and then take on a new role when  appropriate.</p>
<p>I like to think that the Warrior Spirit is defined by its  focus on a mission. Warriors are capable individuals sent to complete  tasks by any means necessary. We were the ones getting sent on quests to  find treasures stolen by the gods. We were the ones sent to handle  sticky situations with enemy tribes. Historically, legendary warriors  resorted as much to diplomacy, trickery, and seduction as they did to  outright combat. They weren’t limited by their role.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s All in Your Head</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, the distinction is mental; what makes one  person a role-filler and another a mission-completer is their  perspective on their activity. Make no mistake, perspective is extremely  important though, because it determines how capable we judge ourselves.  Just seeing a mountain trail from the wrong angle can be enough to suck  the strength from our legs, so we can try to view it from an angle that  does not make us feel too small for the task. By doing this, we attempt  greater deeds than we think ourselves capable of and are usually  pleasantly surprised to find ourselves up to the task.</p>
<p>By viewing our lives as dedicated to the completion of a  mission, we never reach a dead end. If we find ourselves in a situation  that prevents us from completing our mission, we can freely move to a  difference position—at least we are not prevented by our own view of  what we can and cannot do.</p>
<p>But what happens when we define ourselves by our role?</p>
<p>Then, when we get stuck, we are truly stuck. How many  artists refuse to do the necessary work of promotion and outreach  because “artists don’t do business”? They limit themselves.</p>
<h2><strong>Interchanging Post and Mission</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Stop trying to be something, and instead do stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>One person’s post may be another’s mission, but it is one  thing to say, “I want to be a painter,” and another to say, “I want to  make a living painting beautiful art.” In the first case, you may try to  conform to your image of a painter. That may not be economically  viable, especially if it matches the “artists don’t do business” image.  In the second case, you do what it takes to paint and sell you art,  including perfecting your craft, but also learning to network, promote  and sell.</p>
<p>The result is that you learn a number of skills and  empower yourself to overcome whatever obstacles might come your way,  creative, financial, or personal.</p>
<h2><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>In relation to myself, I think this means I need to get  out of my head the idea of simply being a writer and focus more on doing  that things that make up the life of the adventurous storyteller I want  to become. Writing is a big part of that, but so is travel, training,  martial arts, exploration, love, and storytelling as a craft distinct  from putting words to paper.</p>
<p>So, how do you characterize your position in life right  now? Are you on a mission, or are you simply trying to fill a role  defined by society or others?</p>
