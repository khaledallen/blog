excerpt: I'm scaling Warrior Spirit down as my life undergoes some big changes. Thanks
  for coming along for the ride.

<p>Warrior Spirit has been a wonderful adventure, but I'm sad to say I have decided to scale it back considerably.</p>
<p>I haven't really been able to focus it and lately, it has felt more of an obligation and a burden than something I get excited for. Also, my life is undergoing massive changes at the moment, and I feel that Warrior Spirit, as something that was started right after college, is making it difficult for me to let go of my old ways in order to grow, largely because I have several hundred eyes on me as I'm shifting things around.</p>
<p>What that means is that the email exercises will be discontinued, and the blog posts will be reduced to once a month. I may write more, but I'm not going to hold myself to it. The emails will simply be converted to an RSS feed of the blog, so you'll get updates whenever a new post is published.</p>
<p>I know many readers have been inspired by what I've written, and I want to let you know how much I appreciate your support. I'll keep all the old articles up, and of course there will be occasional new ones.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Be well,<br />
Khaled Allen (**</p>
