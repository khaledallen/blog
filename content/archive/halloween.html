<p>All Hallow's Eve was spent introducing my old high school friend to the Wii while answering the doorbell for trick or treaters. Kids these days have apparently developed a sense of entitlement. Doorbell rings, I open door, they stick out their bags and grab candy. No "trick or treat" no "Happy Halloween", just give me candy. To be fair, a few of them actually went through the ritualistic greeting. We even had one kid ask to use our bathroom, but it turned out we had no toilet paper stocked so he just left.</p>
<p>Also, apparently kids still recognize Indiana Jones! I am not too old yet, though perhaps I have that ridiculous new movie to thank for this.</p>
<p>We also had one group from my old high school. Not in costume, but still, it was nice.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween y'all! Don't get too hopped up on sugar.</p>
