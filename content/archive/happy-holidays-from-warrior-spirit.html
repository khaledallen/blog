<p>It's Christmas, which happens to be my family's winter-esque holiday of choice, so I'm wishing all my amazing readers a Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>It's been an exciting year for me and Warrior Spirit. We got a new domain all our own, we revamped the blog, and doubled our readership (I know!). Thank you all for your encouragement and support. I hope to continue to provide inspiration and entertainment in my adventures in life and blogging in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Holidays!</strong></p>
