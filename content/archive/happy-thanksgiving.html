<p>Gratitude is hugely underestimated as a practice, but theories as diverse as time psychology and Buddhism encourage us to take some time to reflect on all that we have to be grateful for. Since reading <em><a title="The Time Paradox" href="http://www.thetimeparadox.com/" target="_blank">The Time Paradox</a>, </em>I have made a habit of keeping a gratitude journal in order to re-tool how I viewed my past from a childhood of frustration and loneliness to one of self-empowerment and creative insight.</p>
<p>It is also important to show appreciation to the people who help you out. None of us can change the world on our own, so if we are honest with ourselves, we must realize that we owe a lot of our success to others. If we want to continue receiving that support, it's a good idea to offer thanks to those who gave it.</p>
<p><strong>So, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I offer my appreciation and gratitude.</strong><strong><!--more--></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have a lot to be thankful for this year.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to my blog readers for their constant support and encouragement. No matter how hard things have gotten, you've always let me know how useful you find my writing and that helps me keep going.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to Brett at <a title="You May be Strong...but are You Tough?" href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/03/you-may-be-strong-but-are-you-tough/" target="_blank"><em>The Art of Manliness</em></a> for giving me the opportunity to reach a wider audience, and for being an inspiration to young men like myself.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to Steve of <a title="The Amazing Spiderman Workout" href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/05/02/amazing-spiderman/" target="_blank"><em>Nerd Fitness</em></a> for the original guest post that got me noticed by Brett, and his support in my blogging.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to my sister for inviting me to Chicago to visit her and the city where I went to school. It was such a great experience to share in the wonderful life she's built for herself there.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to my parents for their constant support and for understanding as I navigate the fine line between <a title="6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/" target="_blank">accepting</a> it and <a title="Mantra for Strength" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/mantra-for-strength/" target="_blank">fighting my own battles</a>.</p>
<p>The friends I've made in Boulder have opened up an entirely new world of relating to my peers. They have allowed me to create a network of support and mutual respect and to operate from a place of authenticity and <a title="Pursue Your Bliss with Integrity" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/pursue-your-bliss-with-integrity/" target="_blank">faith in my own mission</a>.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to all the mentors who have taken me under their wings and helped me <a title="The World is What You Make It, So Make It Good" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-world-is-what-you-make-it-so-make-it-good/" target="_blank">stay upbeat</a> and on track. Without asking for anything in return, they shared their hard-earned wisdom and experience.</p>
<p>I'm thankful to my lovely partner, Anna. I could not have asked for a better person to share the trials and frustrations that I have faced starting a life in Boulder. Her <a title="On Grace" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/on-grace/" target="_blank">grace</a> and wisdom in dealing with bumps in the road have constantly astounded me.</p>
<p>I am thankful to Anna's parents as well for giving her such a solid foundation from which to operate.</p>
<p>In general, I'm thankful that I get to live in such a beautiful town as <a title="I’m Moving to Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/" target="_blank">Boulder</a>, even if it is sometimes insular and eerily utopian. Even the challenges and <a title="Asking for Help" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/asking-for-help/" target="_blank">dark times</a> I've faced this year have helped temper my spirit, and there are no lasting scars from any of them.</p>
<p>Going into the holiday season, I can honestly say things are looking up. <strong>I'm hopeful about the future and have some exciting plans to formalize the lessons from the Warrior Spirit and bring them to a wider audience</strong>. If only I can find the time.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Thanksgiving!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Who and what are you thankful for this year?</strong></em></p>
