    is a term I recognized from studying Buddhism.

<p>I was reading a short piece on creative motivation last  week that asserted that very few of our thoughts are truly our own.  According to the author, most of what we think falls into the category  of ‘monkey-mind,’ which is a term I recognized from studying Buddhism.</p>
<p>Basically it refers to the thought process that jumps from  one topic to another without ever really getting anywhere. Like a  distracted monkey in a playpen, the mind simply takes up whatever  catches its interest for a moment. It may play with the idea for a  while, but quickly discards it for another.</p>
<p>Contrast this with true clarity of thought in which the  mind is focused on a singular aim at the exclusion of all else. By  remaining focused and mostly empty, the clear mind can direct all its  energies to accomplishing some task or plan.<!--more--></p>
<h3>Creation from Nothing</h3>
<p>In terms of creative ideas, a similar thing happens. If we  spend too much time reading and researching, comparing ourselves to  others and trying to please or impress an imaginary audience, our ideas  are never truly original. They are merely iterations of others’ ideas.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we try to silence the constant  stream of input, and learn to make our own judgements and rely on our  own perspective, we just might come up with an idea that arises purely  from our own experience.</p>
<h3>Blaze Your Own Trail of Ideas</h3>
<p>Of course, this is scary. It requires that we trust  ourselves to go out and try things. We have to make our own judgement  calls on whether something might be a good idea, rather than rely on  someone else testing it before us. We have to strike out into the  wilderness and rely on our own sense of direction and ability to read a  compass, instead of sticking to a trail that someone else has made.</p>
<p>But if we don’t, how will we discover new vistas and treasures that might be only a few feet off the beaten trail?</p>
<p>Strike out on your own. Trust your instinct. Don’t worry  if you don’t have everything charted out ahead of you. Just start  whatever project you are thinking about, and let yourself figure out the  best course as you go.</p>
