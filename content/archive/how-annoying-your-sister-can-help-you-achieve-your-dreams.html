<p>My new theory on success is based on techniques I developed annoying my sister, applied to the universe (thanks, L).</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I say something I want to be right about: Mommy likes me better.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">She says the opposite, or simply refutes my argument: Nuh uh!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I persist: Uh huh!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">We repeat the process until one of us tires and the other person's perception is accepted as fact.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In relation to the universe, it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I tell everyone I meet that I do something exciting and groundbreaking: I'm a natural movement trainer and inspirational writer.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The universe denies this fact: Nuh uh! Nobody wants to pay you so you can't do that. <a title="Lessons Learned About Landing a Job in Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-about-landing-a-job-in-boulder/">Get a job</a> working for The Man instead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I persist, neglecting to tell people that I do work a less glamorous job to pay the bills: I'm a natural movement trainer. I help people <a title="Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/">break out of the human zoo</a>, <a title="Fitness is Play" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-play/">rediscover their childhood spontaneity</a>, and connect it all to the fate of the ecosystem through thought-provoking articles. Oh, yeah, I do some other stuff for the time being, until this picks up momentum (which it will).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The universe starts to wear down: FINE! Here's a client. Now stop bugging me.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I insist that I make a living doing this amazing dream job: I have very exclusive rates and lots of clients.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The universe rolls its eyes, but it is getting tired of arguing</span><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> with me so it starts to accept my view as reality and moves on to other people.</span></li>
<li>I end up living a comfortable life doing something I love and making a difference in peoples' lives and my community. FTW!</li>
</ol>
<p>The universe, it turns out, it way less resilient than my sister, so you can guess which of us (me or the universe) is going to win this one.</p>
<p>The more people I meet, the more chances I have to <a title="Tell a Story, Change the World" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/tell-a-story-change-the-world/">tell my story</a> of who I am and what my life is. Eventually, it will simply have to become a reality because everyone in <a title="I’m Moving to Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/">Boulder</a> will assume I'm that awesome guy who helps people break free of the human zoo and whose writing makes them question and define their spiritual purpose.</p>
<p>Delusional? Not if I keep my wits about me and do what needs to be done. I do have a normal job, and I do my due diligence.</p>
<p>But when people ask me what I do,<strong> I tell them what I do in my soul, not what I do in reality</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because I want them to think of me in the role I want to fill, not the one I currently inhabit.</p>
<p>So far, it's working.</p>
<p><em>It occurs to me this is similar to </em>The Law of Attraction<em>, </em>The Secret<em>, and </em>Think and Grow Rich<em>, but I feel that my approach is more pragmatic and speaks to something all of us with siblings have experienced.</em></p>
