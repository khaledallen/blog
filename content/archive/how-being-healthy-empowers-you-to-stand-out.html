<p><a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sunflower.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3114" alt="sunflower" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sunflower.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></a>Being in good shape puts you at odds with a lot of society. It denies--or at least minimizes--the value of some of our culture's greatest accomplishments: abundant food, two cars in every driveway, accessible technology, drugs for every ailment. It's generally poor form to question or refuse these blessings of civilization. It angers the other sheep when you start asking questions.</p>
<p>The truth is, our society is not structured to help individuals achieve their greatest potential in health. We've done a very good job of eliminating the stressors that temper our bodies, with the result that our daily lives do not provide the stimulus we need to stay in our best shape. <strong>Now, if we want to develop our bodies, we have to go out of our way to do it.</strong></p>
<p>To be healthy, we need to take time out of our life in order to perform extensive and inconvenient maintenance (unless you're one of those people who <em>actually enjoys</em> being active, then maybe you take time out of your life for your job). The alternative is to simply accept what most of the American population does: that chronic disease is inevitable, that the ability to lift and carry more than you weigh is impossible, that hoisting yourself over an object by your own strength is beyond human capability.</p>
<p>Compared to the norm, we have to eat differently, act differently, move differently, sleep differently. To a certain extent, we have to purposefully ostracize ourselves, choose certain friends that can support our habit, and stick out. Other's may respect and even envy health, but that doesn't make it any easier.</p>
<h3>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</h3>
<p>That lifestyle sounds a lot like the one followed by many game-changers and amazingly successful people. From what I've read and researched, starting a successful business that makes a difference requires you to live by a different set of rules. You do things and believe in possibilities that other people don't even consider. You question the status quo about money or the kind of influence you can have. You certainly don't play by the standard rules of go-to-school-get-good-grades-get-a-safe-job.</p>
<p><strong>So essentially, to break out of the status quo in anything, whether it's health, wealth, influence, or comedy, you have to be a radical</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<h3>Add a Little Crazy into your Fitness Routine</h3>
<p>To bring the conversation back to health, besides the expected benefits of increased energy, fewer medical issues, and greater confidence stemming from greater strength and endurance, <strong>achieving a healthy lifestyle teaches you a little bit about being a radical</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you only stick to the 6 low-hanging fruits in <a title="Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/">The Warrior Spirit Principles of Health</a>, which are the least obtrusive habits you can adopt that will get you 80% of the way to being vibrantly healthy, you're going to have to take a stand against the status quo. For example, the very first thing I recommend is to stop drinking sugar. Think about how ubiquitous liquid sugar is:</p>
<ul>
<li>soda pop with every meal;</li>
<li>high-fructose corn syrup added to 'health' foods like yogurt, granola, and sports supplements;</li>
<li>sweetened water masquerading as fruit juices;</li>
<li>and who drinks plain black coffee anymore?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you add alcohol (a sugar) to the mix, then you're really down to drinking just water, milk, tea, and black coffee. You'll discover the strangely ostracizing effect of ordering a simple glass of water whenever you're at a party, or even a restaurant.</p>
<p>While it's up to you to balance how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, one thing is definitely true: <strong>being able to stand by your health choices in the face of the status quo will teach you how to stand out, stick to your principles, and forge a path of your own despite it being an uphill battle.</strong></p>
<p>These abilities are essential in many areas of life, not the least of which is pursuing a <a title="How to Find Your Bliss: 3 Questions to Ask Yourself" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-to-find-your-bliss-3-questions-to-ask-yourself/">passion</a> and making a difference.</p>
<h3>Training for Success</h3>
<p>By definition, to make a difference, you need to fight the inertia of the status quo. The hardest part isn't necessarily the fight, it's the fact that you always have the option to just relax, do nothing, and enjoy the comforts being offered at every turn.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're used to getting up early every morning to run up a mountain before work, or routinely pulling two times your bodyweight off the ground, or climbing ledges and bars and ropes, then maybe cheap, easy comforts aren't so seductive to you. If you know how to look past the fatigue and the inconvenience of a workout to the freedom and sense of power you gain after months of hard work, you might not have so much trouble looking past the late nights, frugal living, and constant diligence of a startup to the freedom you gain and the impact you have.</p>
<p>The psychological path of the warrior, as symbolized in myths and hero stories the world over, involves a period of isolation from the tribe or the community. Either because the hero has chosen a greater destiny or had it thrust upon her, she must face challenges alone. These are challenges that only she is worthy to face, by virtue of her courage and willingness to answer a higher calling. In the myths, they are frequently challenges that have felled lesser mortals.</p>
<p>But, once the challenge is completed, the hero can return to her community with a new ability or gift to offer it, something that benefits the world.</p>
<p><strong>Being different, and sometimes being alone, is a small, temporary price to pay for leading a richer life.</strong></p>
