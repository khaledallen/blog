excerpt: I know that lately, I haven't been posting as regularly as  I used to. I've
  felt the consequences. My readership has declined, and I feel like my writing style
  has gotten a little stiff from lack of flexing. Writing has always been a hugely
  important part of my life. Not only is it an artistic means to express myself, it
  has always been associated with periods of balance in my life; when I'm writing
  regularly, my mind and spirit are in order, and a lot of other things as well. When
  I can't find the time to write, things slowly come apart at the seams. I don't really
  know why this is. Perhaps writing is how I parse my jumbled thoughts into discrete,
  comprehensible units called words and sentences, which I can then manipulate and
  act on in my life. Without taking the time to do this, my thoughts and ideas just
  fill to the brim and overflow in a messy jumble of psychic disorder. Writing is
  a form of meditation, a kind of waking dreaming for me.

<p>So, as you can see, it is very important to me that I write regularly. Blogging has the added benefit of being a social medium, allowing me to interact, inspire, and share with others. So I'm trying to find ways to integrate blogging into my daily routine more regularly and consistently.</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wake up before anyone else and write first thing in the morning</strong>: I like this one because it means I can focus, my mind is (relatively) clear from the troubles of the day, and it motivates me to get up early so I can write. The only problem here is that I coach at 6am two days of the week, but these can be my exception days.</li>
<li><strong>Set aside a specific time in the evening to write</strong>: This has worked in the past. The idea is to determine a time of night after which I am not allowed to do any work on things besides my personal projects. This means I wouldn't do research for Forbes, I would avoid updating Farm to Table, and I would stay away from planning workouts at my gym. The only problem with this for me now is that my work schedule is so erratic, I sometimes have to work in the late evenings.</li>
<li><strong>Give writing-in-the-moment priority</strong>: Basically, I write when I'm inspired, dropping everything else. This worked during the summer, though it infuriated my family. I'd be in the middle of a conversation and then sit down to start an article that was inspired, and I would insist on finishing it before doing anything else. Not very reliable, unless you have no outside obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Write shorter posts</strong>: Besides making it less time-consuming to follow me, this also frees me of the necessity to dedicate large chunks of time to blogging. If I know I only need ten minutes to generate quality content, I won't procrastinate. When I know it'll take me half an hour, then I am more likely to put writing off until a more 'convenient' time.</li>
</ul>
