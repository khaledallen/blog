<p dir="ltr">Yesterday, I brought up the reality that we all have <a title="The Hard Questions" href="http://wp.me/p15g8X-Po">troubling questions</a> we'd rather not deal with in our lives, demons that give us excuses to be complacent or hold ourselves back. To answer them is to face our own <a title="Insecurity, the Root of All Evil" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/">insecurities</a> and <a title="6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/">weaknesses</a>. Today, I'm going to dissect those demons so we can vanquish them and pursue our heroic destiny.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many of these hard questions involve questioning the investment. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Am I really happy in this relationship?" -- If the answer is no, it would mean ending a long-term emotional, time, and material investment. If we know the answer will be 'no,' we may avoid asking the question at all.</li>
<li>"Why do I stay at a job I hate?" -- The answer to this question often reveals perceived character flaws, things we'd rather not believe about ourselves. Maybe we believe we aren't qualified for anything better, or we think quitting would make us look bad.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">People are reluctant to break up long-term relationships because they’ve already invested so much in them, or they are afraid to quit a job because they worked so hard to get it in the first place.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">A Choose-Your-Own-Reality Adventure</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Why can't we just see an obvious answer, internalize it, and act on it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The best explanation comes from a psychological theory called cognitive dissonance, which just sounds uncomfortable. It posits that humans have a natural inclination to seek consistency in our lives and actions. If we detect an inconsistency, we feel cognitive stress, which can manifest in a variety of ways from general anxiety up to psychosomatic disorders. Naturally, we will work to eliminate it, even if that means changing our beliefs (which is what the demons of mediocrity want). If we are successful, we can avoid the stress, but some things cannot be hidden, so even if we refuse to acknowledge them consciously, we still know there is an inconsistency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The classic illustration of this is Aesop's fable, "The Fox and the Grapes":<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><i>Driven by hunger, a fox tried to reach some grapes hanging high on the vine but was unable to, although he leaped with all his strength. As he went away, the fox remarked, 'Oh, you aren't even ripe yet! I don't need any sour grapes.' People who speak disparagingly of things that they cannot attain would do well to apply this story to themselves</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It seems childish, but we do it all the time.<strong> Humans (to say nothing of foxes) try to make their current actions and beliefs consistent with their past actions and beliefs.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we admit that a relationship isn't serving us, staying in it would create cognitive dissonance. But since the cost of leaving it would be so high, we can maintain consistency by refusing to admit the truth in the first place.</li>
<li>If we tried hard to get a job, it implies that we wanted it very badly, but to quit would imply that we didn't really value it. On the other hand, if we try hard to get a job, but don't, we may work to convince ourselves it was a bad fit anyway. This creates consistency between our actions and beliefs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Trouble Letting Go</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A related explanation is the sunk cost fallacy, which comes from economics and explains an investor's tendency to favor losing investments simply because he or she has already spent money on them. We've all heard this one from our dad: <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">"I’ve paid for this day at the amusement park, so we’re damn well going to enjoy it" (never mind the fact that it’s raining and everyone's miserable). </span>The goal was to have an enjoyable family vacation, not to make use of the park. At this point, you’d be better served by going back to the hotel to watch a movie.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Unadorned Life is the Only One We're Living</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we've seen where the hard-question-imps get their power, it shouldn't be too hard to reveal them for the delusions they really are.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The antidote is simply to assess life as it presents itself to you, right now. Drop your expectations, delusions, and <a title="Empower Yourself Through Humility" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empower-yourself-through-humility/">pride</a> and look at the world as it really is. The sword of truth cuts through the fog of deception, as they say in warrior circles.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remind yourself of your original goal.</li>
<li>Look past the hard answer and the changes it implies to the end result. There is light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
<li>Step outside of yourself. What 'no-BS' advice would you give your best friend?</li>
<li>Let go of your pride, admit you're human, and that you make mistakes to learn and grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the process of actually changing is still going to be rough, but hopefully adopting these mindsets can help you feel hopeful that the change will benefit you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Only through this kind of unbiased, unadorned assessment can we get past sticking points in our life.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> ***</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Some hard questions I’ve faced in my life, the answer I told myself out loud, and <em>the real answers</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a title="Was Going to College a Mistake?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/was-going-to-college-a-mistake/">Why did I go to this expensive, prestigious, difficult college</a>?” -- Because it was the perfect match for a brilliant student like myself. <em>Because I didn’t know what else to do after high school and it was expected of me.</em></li>
<li>“<a title="Why I Left My Job: To Start Again" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-i-left-my-job-to-start-again/">Why don’t I just quit this job if I can’t stand being here?</a>” -- Because it has great potential and I just need to find my stride. <em>Because I’m afraid my parents will be disappointed, because I’m afraid my girlfriend will think I’m a bum, and I’m afraid to confront my boss.</em></li>
<li>“Is this relationship actually making me happy?” -- We’re just in a rough spot. I’m still around so of course it’s making me happy. <em>I fight with my girlfriend almost every day, and I enjoy myself more when she’s not around.</em> (Just to be clear, this is definitely a reference to a past relationship, not my current one.)</li>
<li>"Why am I broke at the end of every month?" -- I didn't have a choice on that flight home for vacation and those meals out. It was just an unusual month. Next month, these things won't crop up. <em>I actually don't plan ahead, have trouble saying 'no', and willfully avoid looking at my accounts on a regular basis because I don't want to deal with the reality of my dwindling balance.</em></li>
<li>“Do I really think wealth is unimportant?” -- I enjoy simple pleasures, so I don’t need much money. Since I can’t control my wealth, there’s not point in fretting about it. <em>No, and I only say this because I’m not sure I can become wealthy. It’s easier to accept poverty than to do the hard work, both material and psychological, to generate wealth.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Ouch! I winced reading those to myself.</p>
<p>Just like pulling a bad tooth, though, once I addressed the issues I was avoiding, I felt much better and was able to progress on my path to awesome!</p>
