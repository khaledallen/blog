<p>It isn't very often that we get to cross out a big goal in our lives, but that is exactly what I did at the end of November. I'd been dreaming of <a title="Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/">becoming a MovNat trainer</a> since I heard about the method in 2009. Around April of last year, when MovNat announced they were offering trainer certifications, I finally decided to make this dream a reality. I couldn't afford the certification with what I was making as an ESL teacher; I would have to raise the money by <a title="Lessons Learned on Finishing My First Book" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-on-finishing-my-first-book/">writing and promoting</a> an eBook, which I published in September of 2012.</p>
<p>By November of 2012, I had raised enough from donations for the eBook (as well as a few t-shirt sales) to sign up for my MovNat trainer certification in March 2013.</p>
<p>It was a long road to get there, but the most valuable thing I got out of the whole experience won't be the MCT certification itself. <strong>Instead, it is the confidence that I can affect my life without permission from anyone else</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<h3>What a Ride</h3>
<p>I didn't have the resources to do what I wanted, so I figured out how I could make something from what I did have. I guess that is entrepreneurship at its finest (or just problem-solving, as my girlfriend would point out).</p>
<p>I simply took everything I knew, came up with a way to share it with people, with an eye towards empowering people to take control of their own health, and wrote something. I <a title="How One Writer’s Social Hestitations Led to Something Great" href="http://marianlibrarian.com/2012/09/how-one-writers-social-hestitations-led-to-something-great/" target="_blank">promoted it frantically</a>, <a title="I’m Thankful For…The Twitter Community I’ve Found" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-thankful-for-the-twitter-community-ive-found/">made a lot of friends</a>, and <a title="Integrity in Action: Why I’m Not Charging for My Book" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/integrity-in-action-why-im-not-charging-for-my-book/">trusted in the sincerity</a> of <a title="The Communion of Play; A Day of Natural Movement on the River" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-communion-of-play-a-day-of-natural-movement-on-the-river/">my message</a>. I networked and pitched guest posts (the <a title="The Time to Move is Now" href="http://mizfitonline.com/2012/09/14/the-time-to-move-is-now-guest-post/" target="_blank">first offer</a> was from Carla Birnberg of MizFit Online, and I responded with enthusiasm <del>by bouncing up and down like a bunny on speed</del>). A lot of it was faith that the community would help me get more involved.</p>
<p>And in the end, all that effort paid off. People helped me, I made the money, and one day, I went up on MovNat's website, typed in my PayPal information, and signed up for the course. Months of hard work culminated in a few clicks of the mouse, though the real finish line will be the class itself.</p>
<h3>Change Your Mind, Change Your World</h3>
<p>In April, when I started this project, I couldn't really see how I was going to make it happen. Luckily, I had a lot of guidance from books like <em><a title="Book Review: The Art of Non-Conformity" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-art-of-non-conformity/">The Art of Non-Conformity</a>, The $100 Startup,</em> and<em> The 4-Hour Workweek. </em>The advice from those books helped me see a vague outline of the path that would get me to where I wanted to be. I didn't know the details, but I knew the waypoints and major landmarks.</p>
<p>I also learned a lot on my own. The technical stuff if pretty easy -- break things down to the smallest possible steps, set SMART goals, create deadlines, be organized -- so I want to talk about the mindset here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be passionate</strong>. More than anything else I did, this made all the difference. I wrote about movement, health, and personal integrity with real commitment, because <a title="The Things That Matter" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-things-that-matter/">these things matter to me</a>. This belief came across in my blog posts and my tweets, and convinced people that I was the real deal, that they could safely put their trust in me to the extent of giving money for a book I wrote. And more than anything, I really wanted to become involved with MovNat. I see natural movement as one of the best ways to promote <a title="Move and Be Free" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/">personal empowerment</a> and connection with the environment. Given where I was at the time -- a small apartment in urbanized Korea, working at an oppressive job -- the hope of becoming expert in natural, free, joyful movement, and sharing that with others, was extremely motivating.</li>
<li><strong>Be unrealistic</strong>. My expectations for what it would mean to become a MovNat trainer were admittedly overblown. I envisioned myself running wild through the forest, at one with the trees and animals, leading a tribe of like-minded people in an exploration of their primal nature. Deep down, I knew I had my head in the clouds, but a small part of me was enticed by the possibility of this becoming reality, even in just a small way. So I let myself daydream. And that <a title="Forget the Resolution! Set a Challenge!" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/forget-the-resolution-set-a-challenge/">ridiculous, over-the-top dream</a> was much more motivating than a more realistic and down-to-earth could have been.</li>
<li><strong>Be stubborn</strong>. If there's one thing I've learned about big goals, it's that life will do everything it can to stop you. At first, obstacles will be small: the logistics of finding time to write, no time to cook. Pretty soon, things will escalate: your relationships get rocky, your boss comments on your new beard. Don't spook. Your relationship is more robust than you think, and your boss won't fire you for looking unkempt. Next are your inner demons: you convince yourself the world doesn't need your ideas, that you're wasting your time, that you simply aren't meant to do this. <em>You </em>will start making excuses and looking for ways out, for no good reason. You will somehow arrive at the weird conclusion that to see your dream out might make you an irresponsible person. Don't listen! When it comes down to it, all you can do is keep your head down and continue. Do the work. Meet your deadlines. Trust in your mission.</li>
<li><strong>Have Faith</strong>. People will ask you why you are working so hard for something that might not even be worth it. They will point out that you aren't having any fun, and in the middle of it, you will wonder how anything could be worth all this work. Dare to believe that it will be worth it. You don't get a guarantee ahead of time. That's the test life puts out to see how bad you want it.</li>
<li><strong>Rely on friends.</strong> Find a community. Open up. Share your struggles with PEOPLE WHO WANT YOU TO SUCCEED. They will assure you that you're on the right path, and they can give examples of people who are happy and successful doing what you want to do. One of the biggest motivators in pushing through at the end was the support of MovNat trainers basically inviting me to become one of them. You choose who you lean on, so you might as well pick people who demonstrate an ability and a willingness to inspire and help you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is with great excitement, and immense gratitude, that I formally announce that the eBook project was a success and that I am all set to become a MovNat Certified Trainer.</p>
<p><strong><em>I'd love to hear any input on the mindsets the empower us to make our biggest goals a reality. And, of course, if you've accomplish something big, please share in the comments.</em></strong></p>
