<p><strong>Remember dying of dysentery on Oregon Trail, that game that was supposed to teach you about the history of the pioneers who opened up the frontier? How much besides that do you remember about it?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>If you ask most people, they mainly remember dying of diseases, losing gear trying to cross rivers, and that it was very easy to shoot buffalo. They don't remember most of the historical context of the game.</p>
<p><strong>The game was meant to teach the history of the trail (I assume), but what it actually taught was the mindset and priorities of a pioneer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's easier to shoot buffalo than to buy and carry food all the way.</li>
<li>The worst thing that can happen is to get sick.</li>
<li>It's better to lose time looking for a ford than to lose gear crossing a river.</li>
</ul>
<p>Games like <em>Civilization</em> and <em>Age of Empires</em> taught the pressures and priorities of international politics and warfare. What made them so great was that you didn't have to copy the course of a historical battle or nation. They were a sandbox that set the constraints of the world and then let you discover the rules for yourself and the best way to succeed within them.</p>
<p>Then you had other educational "games" like Math Olympics (I really hope my old computer teacher isn't reading this). In that game, you had to answer math questions and if you did it fast enough, you'd get an animation of your character performing well in an Olympic event.</p>
<p><strong>It wasn't really a game. It was just a test that gave a cute reward for doing something academic (tricksy hobbitses!). Not...very...motivating.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Weirdly (or not so much), that is exactly how we are expected to learn after childhood: by study and test, NOT exploration. Despite the fact that 99% of all useful knowledge comes from discovering the rules yourself through experimentation.</p>
<p>So why do we focus on study-and-test so much? Because the costs of messing up are so high, it takes a long time to experiment, and it's just easier (aka, lazier) to spew out information and hope it sticks.</p>
<p>Games take away the risk of failure, they simplify things to focus on specific skills, and they give you instant feedback on whether you're doing well or not.</p>
<p><strong>Which is exactly what makes games great for learning: they allow for lots of focused practice in a low-penalty environment that provides real feedback.</strong><!--more--></p>

<p>Good games are good because they support learning in a way that empowers the player. They make it hard (but possible) to do what you want, and let you struggle, giving just enough to reward you for your effort.</p>
<p><strong>But maybe you're saying, "These are just games. They don't translate to the real-world." Actually, they do it you approach them the right way.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Take <em>Halo 2,</em> a classic multiplayer first-person shooter. In order to succeed in online play, you had to predict what other players would do. One common tactic was to wait until just after you'd made a kill to attack. You would be in the middle of reloading and low on shields, so you were very vulnerable.</p>
<p>To deal with this, I developed the habit of scanning over both shoulders right after a fight, moving in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Then, when I started studying for my upper belts in Kenpo, my instructor introduced the idea that after a fight, I'd be vulnerable and an easy target. As soon as I realized that, I automatically started using the same scanning technique, which is actually taught in Kenpo, but I didn't have to learn it all over again. I just translated it from <em>Halo 2</em> to self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>I had learned the habit, in a nearly identical context and with identical results for failure and success, from playing the game.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I didn't set out to learn that from playing the game; I was motivated to play for other reasons. It just happened to be the kind of behavior that the game rewarded.</p>
<p>So, if you are trying to learn a skill, think about the kinds of games that can help you master it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Athletics, dance, or martial arts have rewarding goals that are easier to achieve with good fitness, so you get fit automatically to play well (if you're invested).</li>
<li>Music itself offers similar rewards to gameplay: you can play any notes you want, but only the right ones will sound good.</li>
<li>Various board games teach a variety of skills, from basics of capital (Monopoly) to communicating via pictures (Pictionary). Chess is well-known for its many benefits, from visual tracking to imagining the future to maintaining composure under stress.</li>
<li>Card games, especially poker, are known to teach people-reading and self-control as well as risk-assessment and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key is to actually seek to learn from the game, not just to win it, and to commit to getting good. If you approach a game as pure distraction, it loses its value.</strong></p>
<p><em>For a brilliant example of stealth learning in a game, <a href="http://www.machineers.com/" target="_blank">check out Machineers</a>. This game is designed to teach procedural logic (programming-think for the rest of us) without being blatantly educational. It's won several awards; it's also simply fun.</em></p>
