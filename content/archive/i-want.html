<p>"I want."</p>
<p>When was the last time you said those words in such a direct way? I thought it sounded childish just typing it, the mantra of a two year old child.</p>
<p>When I visited my aunt in Jordan, I couldn't figure out how to say, "May I please have the X?" in Arabic. She explained to me the Arabic phrase I should use if I wanted something: "biddi," which is colloquial Jordanian for "I want."</p>
<p>At first, I was extremely uncomfortable using this phrase. I felt like a selfish brat:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want bread</li>
<li>I want to go to the park</li>
<li>I want to sleep now</li>
<li>I want more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There was no "please" or "can I," Just my raw desires placed in front of my family for them to acknowledge or refuse.</strong></p>
<p>But nobody took it rudely. It was simply how you asked for things -- by stating your wants.</p>
<p>What the other person did with that information was up to them, but they generally assumed I was not being pushy.</p>
<p>In the States, if you say, "I want X," people will give you nasty looks. "What's the magic word?" As if simply expressing your wants without some account for another's possible feelings is the epitome of rudeness.</p>
<p>But after my experience in Jordan, I wondered why we think simply expressing wants is considered rude. You have to coat it in all these other phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you mind…</li>
<li>Please…</li>
<li>I would like…</li>
<li>I would prefer…</li>
<li>It'd be cool if…</li>
</ul>
<p>This all seems very British to me, very indirect. Guess vs ask culture.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there's anything wrong with "please." That's our culture. If you don't say, "please," it sends a very specific kind of message about how you think of the other person.</p>
<p>I'm not one of those who thinks words are everything. <a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/never-apologize-2/">Sorry isn't always an apology</a>. But if you aren't conscious of the words you use, they can certainly come to define the way you think, and this is a great example.</p>

<p><strong>By wrapping our desires in these blunting phrases, we distance ourselves from their poignancy.</strong> We don't feel entitled to simply desire things. To have powerful wants is to be selfish or lustful, obsessed, neurotic. We have to ask permission, make sure nobody else could be offended by the simple knowledge of our desires, dreams, and lusts.</p>
<p><strong>I want to want without needing someone's permission, to pursue my desire with all the love and lust of a predator hunting the prey it so desperately longs for.</strong></p>
<p>How wonderful would it feel to pursue your desires with all the conviction of a child, to dedicate every action and thought to the meaningful acquisition of what you want, to lust in the way a tiger hunts or a gazelle seeks its life, with its whole being?</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me in! Let me in! I love you so much I could eat you. I love you to the very core, especially the soft, juicy parts, the vitals most tender and alive. Surrender to this agony, and you will be transformed into Me. - Seagull, to a crab it wants to eat, according to Alan Watts in <em>Cloud-Hidden</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The seagull wants the very life of the crab, unapologetically, and according to Alan Watts, that's a form of love.</p>
<p>I think you can want something so intimate as another person without objectifying them, with awe and respect. <strong>Isn't that what we mean by love in the best sense, after all?</strong> But maybe we've mixed up wanting with objectifying, and that's why we feel bad about it.</p>
<p>But to truly love-want something, you have to be willing to let it consume you from the inside-out and the outside-in. <strong>There's vulnerability in that. You are consumed as much as you consume.</strong> You can't simply possess it. <em>That's</em> objectification, not love.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why it's scary to simply say "I want." It reveals a bit of vulnerability, even as it acknowledges and validates our core drive. As Alan Watts continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The gull can't really be said to be rapacious or greedy. It's just that his being alive at all is the same thing as eating crabs."</p></blockquote>
<p>And perhaps <em>you're </em>being alive is the same thing as...whatever it is that drives you. Whatever it is you want.</p>
<p><em><strong>Can you want something precious without apologizing for your desire? Even if you never tell anyone but yourself?</strong></em></p>
