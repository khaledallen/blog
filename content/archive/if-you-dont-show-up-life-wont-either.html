<blockquote>Work is love made visible. - Khalil Gibran</p></blockquote>
<p>I have run into two conflicting theories on how success works.</p>
<ol>
<li>You get lucky. Opportunities come along or they don't. You have to be in the right place at the right time or you just won't get very far. Some people have it, and some people don't.</li>
<li>Success is entirely dependent on your willingness to put in hard work and dedicate yourself to accomplishing what you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>People who lean on the first explanation usually don't see themselves as very abundant or successful. They feel a lot of frustration around their lives and their dreams, and so they claim that it's all luck to shirk responsibility for what they see as failing.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has done really well, but he gives off a constant anxiety about losing it all. He uses the "I got lucky" argument in a way that absolves him of responsibility for his success, but my guess is he also doesn't want to think it would be his fault if things don't turn out well.</p>
<p>On the other option is a more empowering viewpoint, but it is also often used to offer excuses. For example, insisting your success is based purely on your hard work might give you permission to ignore others' needs and the realities of the world (market demands, consumer interests, quality of your services, importance of outside help and connections, etc.)</p>
<p>So, of course there's a balance.<!--more--></p>
<h3>Show Up</h3>
<p>A great story from Stephen Pressfield, author of <em>The War of Art,</em> relates his conception of creativity. His Muse would show up at his house, and if it saw that he was at his desk writing, it would stick around. If he wasn't working, it would move on.</p>
<p>There is the element of luck; what time the Muse would show up, how much value it would provide, and how long it would stay were out of his control</p>
<p>But there is also the element of hard work: he had to be ready to receive the Muse by putting in some work.</p>
<p>And that's where presence comes in.</p>
<p><strong>If you are present--if you are paying attention to your life, in the big and small things--then you'll notice when opportunity shows up, and you'll have the emotional reflexes to take advantage of it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But if you don't even have the commitment to show up for your life, why should opportunity and growth?</strong></p>
<p>If you can't even be bothered to be actively engaged in your life, your health, your education, or your relationships, why should success be engaged with you?</p>
<p>Paying attention means showing up and doing the work. Work is simply giving things your diligent attention.</p>
<h3>Love as Attention</h3>
<p>I learned this the hard way in my primary relationship. I was wondering why it wasn't working for me. She didn't seem to get me anymore, and the overall relationship dynamics were just out of step with my values and life.</p>
<p>After working on it on our own and with a therapist, I realized that I hadn't been showing up at all. I had long ago written things off. I didn't address problems, and I didn't show my appreciation.</p>
<p>Lack of engagement for me meant not connecting this relationship with the rest of my life. I would make plans for the future without considering the impact on my partner. I was just running on autopilot--show affection, cook dinner, send a cute text--not bothering to think about what anything meant for our lives together.</p>
<p>All the opportunities for growth, passion, and possibility this relationship could offer were simply passing me by. <strong>As soon as I committed to being present, giving it my attention and taking it seriously, all the things that had been missing suddenly showed up.</strong></p>
<p>Life is the same way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pay attention. I know life is hard and dreary, but you must resist the temptation to shift over to autopilot. I honestly believe that is the greatest struggle a human being faces.<br />
