<blockquote><p>“The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are.” - Anon</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>By the time you read this, I will have landed in Boulder, CO, my new home for the foreseeable future.</strong></p>
<p>That's a little scary to say now. I only decided to move here 30 days ago.</p>
<p>The road that brought me here was sort of a surprise, like a forest path you don't see until you're right on top of it. Nevertheless, it feels right, despite the short notice.</p>
<p>Originally, I was going to move in the summer, after a trip to India, but due to a family concern that has developed, I've decided to stay in the States at least until the end of the year. When I decided India was no longer on the table, I realized there was no reason for me to continue living with my parents. <strong>Then, it became very apparent that staying in Connecticut would be the safe, sensible option, complete with all the stagnation and suffocating comfort that implies</strong>. I had a little money saved up, and a chance encounter with a visiting Boulderian gave me the sign I needed.</p>
<p><strong>It was time to move on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Even though I was free to go, it was still scary because it was not 'according to plan'.</strong> I decided to wait until the end of the month to move in order to say goodbye to friends and family, many of whom were caught totally by surprise.</p>
<p>I am moving to Boulder specifically because I'm planning to study Ecopsychology at Naropa University, starting in the summer. I haven't actually be accepted yet, but I've decided to commit myself and hope the universe picks up on that. Even though the program is distance-learning, I wanted to have access to the community at the University so that I can contribute and interact.</p>
<p>Even if I don't get in, from what I hear, Boulder is a wonderful place to live, full of health-conscious, outdoors-loving, fitness fanatics, Buddhist-hippies and local foodies, so I know I'll fit right in ;-). It's also a small, dense urban center with a pedestrian- and bike-friendly road system, lots of young people, and a lively community, which is exactly the kind of place I want to live. Compared with my parents' home in Connecticut, where you need a car to go anywhere, it should be a welcome change.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to start a coaching practice out there, incorporating spiritual and psychological development with holistic, playful movement in a natural setting, using my MovNat training certification.</p>
<p>I've never been to Boulder before. I'm just going off of a hunch that I'll like it there. I have some money saved up from Korea, but I don't have an apartment yet or a job. <strong>If any of you have friends or know of people looking for roommates, I would be forever grateful if you could put me in touch. Also, if you or anyone you know is looking for someone with my skill set, I would be infinitely grateful for any work leads</strong>.</p>
<p>Wish me luck. I'm sort of jumping into the deep end with this one.</p>
