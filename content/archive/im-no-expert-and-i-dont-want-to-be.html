<p>When I started this blog, I had no aspirations to do  anything more than share my thoughts about life and the world. I figured some of the things I was going through might be  interesting to others, mainly my family. I didn’t really set out to tell  anyone how to live their life or even provide advice. I was just  sharing my experience of life.</p>
<p>This differs markedly from how blogs are getting used these days as a platform to establish the author as an expert with no other credentials besides the blog itself.<!--more--></p>
<h2><strong>Self-Certification</strong></h2>
<p>A lot of bloggers use their blog as a way to set  themselves up as an expert on a topic and they use this status to  convince people to pay them money for information. Blogging becomes a  sort of credential in an of itself.</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a little silly. Why would I  pay some average Joe with a nice website to organize my life or coach me  on productivity? Some of the blogger life-coaches out there are  truly…let’s call them niche.</p>
<p>But seeing successes of other bloggers got me thinking that maybe I could make some money through <em>my</em> blog. Of course, that meant selling out and writing about things that  would rank higher on the search engines. It would require spending more  time on ‘product development’ and marketing, providing subscription  incentives, and collecting an e-mail list. It would change the way I  wrote, to make the blog more attractive to skimming, time-starved  readers, with more short, punchy blurbs and fewer thought-out  paragraphs. Because at the end of the day, the experts are those who get  the most traffic.</p>
<p>More than anything else, it would require that I deceive  my readers by trying to create the image of myself as an expert with  secret, coveted knowledge that you’d all want to pay money to find out.  That is the standard model after all:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a blog about a topic</li>
<li>Build a massive audience to increase your legitimacy.  Do this through shameless self-promotion on Twitter and as many guest  posts as you can get.</li>
<li>Establish yourself as an ‘expert’</li>
<li>Offer your readers a ‘comprehensive, ultimate guide to  X’ where you share, under full disclosure, the ‘secrets’ of your  industry that everybody else keeps hidden.</li>
<li>Charge money for the above.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a little while I did try a few strategies to follow  the more ‘professional’ blogging model, but so much of it seemed  dishonest to me. Obviously, I should make it easy to subscribe and  follow me, but I realized that I should focus on providing good content  with integrity. Writing how-to posts about fixing your life with a  really edgy tone just wasn’t me. If that was how to turn my blog into a  money-maker, I was going to have to settle for less.</p>
<h2><strong>Doing it My Way</strong></h2>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. I’d love to have a mass of raving  fans who read all my stuff and share it like some tropical fever. I’d  also love to make money off my blog, and I even want to write and offer  an eBook (there’s one in the works, actually).</p>
<p>But I’m not going to find cheats to get more subscribers.  I’m not going to pressure new visitors with pop-ups and incessant calls  to join my newsletter. I’m not going to alter the content of my writing,  or its style, in order to make it search-engine friendly. And I’m not  going to charge money for an eBook that I put together for friends. For  now, my stories are offered for free, in exchange for your conversation  and feedback.</p>
<p>I do believe that I am good at what I do, as a writer and  an athlete. But to me, there is the limitation that I’m only good at  these things as they relate to my life. I can provide examples of how I  made things work for myself, but I can’t tell you how to do things for  yourself.</p>
<p>If you haven’t noticed, I don’t really like the <a title="Don’t Trust the Experts" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/dont-trust-the-experts/">concept of  an expert</a>. I am not an expert at anything I do, because I am constantly  learning and growing. I don’t really intend to ever have true mastery  of anything I undertake because I’ve learned that the more you know, the  less you know. And what little mastery I do possess applies almost  exclusively to my own situation.</p>
<p>That said, I try to be useful and inspiring. Maybe that’s  enough to make a living off my ideas. I’d like to support myself with my  writing.</p>
<p>I realize you read my blog because I write interesting and  thought-provoking articles that inspire. Maybe experts have a lot of  traffic because people recognize valuable information and flock to it,  rather than experts become such because they know how to drive traffic.  The expertise brings the traffic. The traffic doesn’t make the expert.</p>
<p>So I’ll just keep writing with as much integrity as I can about my journey in ways that hopefully inspire others.</p>
