<p>I'm happy to announce that I have finally landed a job in Boulder, which means that I can stay.</p>
<p>As you know, <a title="Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/">keeping upbeat</a> in the face of difficult prospects has been hard. Especially going into March, which would have been the limit of my savings, I was worried I was going to hit a wall.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily, just as I reached the end of my financial rope, a job came through</strong>. Funny how that works.</p>
<p>Of course, now I have the issue of having too many things to do.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual workaday job at the grocery store, I was also given my first tutoring assignment, and landed my first paid freelance magazine article.</p>
<p><a title="Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/">Coaching MovNat</a> is still my preferred form of employment, but that hasn't resulted in any paying arrangements. However, I'm still giving it as much attention as I can spare, going around to gyms and studios offering to run workshops and introduce myself to as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>My guess is that I will use the consistent job to get established while developing more lucrative opportunities that allow me to work on my own time.</p>
<p>This period of my life is certainly one of the most challenging and uncomfortable, but I can tell it is also fostering a lot of growth. It's the kind of uncomfortable experience that you know is good for you, even if you'd rather not have to go through it. Sort of like exercise (which I guess I'm fairly good at).</p>
<p>Here are a few short lessons I've learned:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Persistence is key</strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">. I went to the grocery store Alfalfa's almost every single day asking about openings. I got into the queue for a position but never made it to the interview, then I got an interview but not the job, and finally I got all the way through. The secret was simply showing up every day, getting to know the employees, and making sure that as soon as an opening appeared, I was around to jump on it. That doesn't sound like a secret actually, just a lot of work. I had two or three of the guys working there rooting for me and pushing my name with the managers, simply because I was friendly and showed up a lot. </span><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">There's a lot to be said for simply showing up.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Go around gatekeepers</strong>. I didn't go through the regular channels to land this job. Normally, I would have filled in an application, submitted it, and then waited around. Actually, I did that that at first, but learned it wasn't really effective. Instead, I went directly to the manager of the department where I heard they had an opening and gave him my name. I got a call the next day and brought in my resume to the interview. I didn't even fill in an application until I was offered the job.</li>
<li><strong>Don't beg</strong>. At my first interview, I was over-prepared and perhaps overeager. I think that hurt me as it may have come off as insincere. At the interview that actually led to a job, I didn't have time to prepare, and I was worn out from hoping so much. The result was that I was more reserved and willing to accept that it wouldn't come to anything. I wasn't as grasping because I was okay with not getting in. I think this helped me make a more relaxed impression that came off as less desperate.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still feel strongly that this is just the beginning. I made a commitment that I wouldn't cower from the choices necessary to end up working for myself, and I'm not going to let myself become complacent. Feel free to badger me about it, o' readers. :-)</p>
