excerpt: Upon leaving Wisconsin, I made my way, via bus, to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St.
  Paul. Even though I'm not from the state, whenever anyone refers to 'the cities'
  it is this metropolis I immediately think of, even when I'm elsewhere. The bus ride
  was uneventful, except for the fact that I missed my first bus and then had to negotiate
  my way on to the next bus out. 5-minutes of lateness cost me $80 in new bus far
  and a taxi ride.

<p>Apologies for the delay. Upon arriving home I discovered my home in the midst of packing to move and have thus been distracted.</p>
<h2>Logistics from Hell</h2>
<p>Upon leaving Wisconsin, I made my way, via bus, to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Even though I'm not from the state, whenever anyone refers to 'the cities' it is this metropolis I immediately think of, even when I'm elsewhere. The bus ride was uneventful, except for the fact that I missed my first bus and then had to negotiate my way on to the next bus out. 5-minutes of lateness cost me $80 in new bus far and a taxi ride.</p>
<p>More logistical problems at the MSP airport prevented me from renting a car from my originally planned company. I thought I'd be stuck completely but they recommended me to another company, which actually ended up costing me less. So it worked out in the end, I made it out of the cities and got on the long, beautiful, pine-wrapped highway of Minnesota, en route to the Northwoods and the lake country.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: This was exactly the fear that had kept me from travelling in the first place. I dealt with it and got to the places I wanted to go. So I learned that I am smart enough and resourceful enough to manage if things go astray. Still, the reliance on my own cash was a little unsettling. What if I ran out of money? I have long ago stopped carrying Daddy's Credit Card.</p>
<h2>Memory Lane on I-35</h2>
<p>The drive up to camp was relaxing. I'd been on the road all day anyway, but it was nice to drive my own (rented) car. I got up to camp around 11:30, feeling completely at home like always. I managed to find some people who knew me sharing a fire in the sailing house and sat with them for an hour, hanging out like we'd been seeing each other all year. There was very little catch up talk and a lot of comfortable silence and random tangents. I slept in a cabin, all alone, which I should know by now is a bad idea. No matter how old I get, the intermediate cabins freak me out with all the windows open and their big, empty wooden rooms. I spent many a summer night as a kid bawling my eyes out in terror in those cabins, and old memories like that never really fade completely. While not afraid per se, I was unconsciously tense all night and didn't actually manage to fall asleep until the sun came up, lulled by the haunting call of the loon and the wind in the pines.<!--more--></p>
<p>The next day, I was up early and started exploring the camp. My old camp director was in the kitchen, making coffee. We caught up and she shared the plans for the summer. Some campers showed up for breakfast, so I left, preferring to be left to reveries of my own camp experiences.</p>
<p>While waiting for the other counselors to awaken, I checked out the old horse barn, where I'd spent so much time. The horses were out, peacefully grazing, and I found eight beautiful eagle feathers in the fields. After picking some wildflowers for a pretty girl, I headed back to main camp and ran into my old friends.</p>
<p>The cool thing about camp is that, even when you're not 'supposed to be there' you still belong, and people think nothing of running into you just walking down the trail when they haven't seen you in a year or so. We greeted, and got on with things. Before I left, I'd been part of a canoe trip to salvage bones and teeth from a deer carcass.</p>
<h2>Boys with Beards</h2>
<p>An old, good friend, one of the few guys in my life I hold as a brother, had called me on the bus ride up and I was happy to discover he was in Duluth. So here was the revealed reason for my trip up north. I hadn't expected to see him at all, but we ended up spending most of Saturday together, exploring Duluth's cafes and chocolate shops, her old factories converted into climbing gyms, and an amazing chronicle of the secret lives of norther Minnesota nightlife: crammed into the space beneath two highway overpasses was a gallery of graffiti. Everything from incoherent rants to political commentary as art shared space in the incidental gallery, making use of the concrete supports, the crossbars, and the walls behind. Walking down the length of it, I was assaulted by the memories and whisperings of the people who had set down their mark on the drab concrete. Truly an amazing experience.</p>
<p>My friend and I drove back down to the cities that night. The conversation in the car was revelatory, in the way that old connections always seem to lead to new directions going forward. We discussed the two topics that is on the mind of every young man: our dreams and the women in our lives. Of course, it is only thanks to the complete lack of judgement and pretension two close friends have that this conversation, which I've had a few times, is saved from degenerating into a simple braggadocio of sexual conquests.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: We as young men need to keep in better touch. We are all facing similar challenges, and have a lot to teach each other. I see so many of my peers heading off into distant, isolated towns to pursue their unique, unconventional version of masculinity in peace, where it will not be challenged. We are both sensitive and rugged, guitarists, trekkers, campers, boys-with-beards. We see more in our life quests than simply making a lot of money, sleeping with beautiful women, and gaining influence. The manner of that influence is vitally important, but what ought we to do with a world that glorifies that image of masculine-as-consumer and destroyer? Where is the place for the defender, the hunter who nourishes nature as much as he profits from it? The shaman? The farmer? Our society glorifies the shark in a suit. So what can we do but abandon that society to the sharks while we try to grow things in safety?</p>
<p>My only concern is what happens when that society, with its image of the masculine, encroaches upon the few outposts where nature is in rhyme with manliness. We will have to change things from within one day. Better to do it earlier rather than later.</p>
<p>-(**</p>
<p>PS: I missed a plane by 5 minutes, was rerouted to another flight that got delayed 5 hours due to mechanical difficulties, and spent all day in airports, getting home 9 hours later than I was supposed to. Lesson: 5-minutes on buses or planes can make all the difference. Don't trivialize travel schedules.</p>
