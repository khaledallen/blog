<p>I love this time of year. The cozy winter drinks, the warm crackling fires after a day in the cold, people bundled up but still extending warm greetings and presents. While it'd be great to be this thoughtful all year, it is still nice to step out of our self-centered mindset, even if just for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The holidays are a time when people take a moment to remember the important people in their lives. My usual holiday tradition has been to write handwritten cards to all the people who have made a difference in my life in the past year. It's sort of a massive thank you note for the intangible things that my friends have done for me throughout the year, whether that was just to be there and listen, to hang out and have fun, or give me much-needed help or advice.</p>
<p>This year, however, I got so caught up in my move to South Korea that I didn't get around to making all the cards. So, if you don't get something from me, please know that doesn't mean I forgot, just that life has been very busy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to my community. This past year, I've learned that so much of what makes us who we are is who makes up our community. We are, to a very large extent, the result of our friends, families, followers, and teachers. <strong>I want to acknowledge just how much of who I am is the result of the generous contributions of others who have seen something in me worth supporting</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>To my readers,</strong> thank you for staying loyal even when I lost faith in my own writing and the blog. Your comments and e-mails meant so much to me. Thank you for getting me back to writing here. I look forward to another year of inspiring posts and thoughtful discussion. You are the reason I write, and writing is the most important thing to me.</p>
<p><strong>To my parents,</strong> thank you for supporting me...always. Even when I do stupid, misguided things, you always stand by me. Sometimes I wish you would warn me first...but I guess you love me enough to let me learn. Thanks for not treating me like a child just because I lived at home after college.</p>
<p><strong>To the rest of my family,</strong> it's been a very intense year for some of us. I do feel like I've grown closer to my more distant relatives. After so long operating in the sphere of my nuclear family, it's nice to see there are others out there.</p>
<p><strong>To my friends,</strong> thank you for staying in touch. We are so dispersed these days, connected only by the tenuous impulses on the internet, and I know that sometimes it feels like the relationships we created are faded. But it is amazing how much a simple e-mail or IM or Facebook note can do to reestablish old line of conversation and connection.</p>
<p><strong>To my girlfriend,</strong> thank you for tolerating my eccentricities. I know there are a lot. How you put up with me with such patience and wisdom confounds me, but I'm glad for it and value it immensely.</p>
<p><strong>To her family,</strong> thank you for accepting me so readily. It's been a bit of a roller-coaster for me getting used to so much love, but I've decided it's something I'd like to make a bigger part of my life.</p>
<p><strong>To my mentors and teachers,</strong> thank you for your investment in me. I know I can be a demanding student, and I try to make up for it by being a diligent one. Your advice and guidance mean much, much more than you'll ever know.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever you celebrate, or even if you don't, have a Happy Holidays! As my friend Cindi writes on <a title="Bring on the Light" href="http://cindimp.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/merry-christmas-bring-on-the-light/" target="_blank">her blog</a>, let's try to bring the spirit of the holidays into the rest of our years.</strong></p>
