<p>Wanna hear an embarrassing story?</p>
<p>My first high school girlfriend engineered an entire evening to get me alone at her place to make out, but I was so inexperienced and shy, I bolted: "Huh, everyone else went home, I guess I should probably head out then, g'night!"</p>
<p>She legitimately pointed out that she just wanted to have a fun summer and didn't really want to spend it waiting for me to catch up. I apologized for feeling shy and scared, but it ended anyway.</p>
<p>A similar thing happened with my next two girlfriends, and the lesson I learned was that my feelings were keeping me from happiness. The solution, I thought, was to deny them, all the while hating myself for having them. I lived in a constant state of apology.</p>
<p><strong>I apologized for everything: what I did, what I said, and worst of all, what I felt, wanted, and who I was.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I apologized for wanting too little intimacy, or too much.</li>
<li>I apologized for having certain thoughts, or not having them.</li>
<li>I apologized for being good at some skills and bad at others. I apologized for feeling anything that I thought might rock the boat.</li>
<li>I apologized for not being "a better boyfriend," and sometimes even for being "a good boyfriend."</li>
</ul>
<p>I would deny my feelings until they broke through, then I'd just apologize and feel guilty.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, my partners didn't appreciate that. The self-denial felt fake, and when things broke down and my true feelings/nature shone through, it seemed like I'd been lying to them.</p>
<p>This mindset infected the way I thought about myself. I would feel something and immediately think, "I shouldn't feel that. I must be a bad person." Or I'd see a Tesla drive by and feel guilty for wanting something so "extravagant." If a personality trait of mine caused conflict, I'd feel like there was something wrong with me.</p>
<p>Things got better eventually, but contemplating marriage, my network of friends and supporters helped me realize things would be very rough if I didn't deal with this issue.</p>
<p><strong>And then one day, on a long run after a hard talk with my fiance, I realized I couldn't live like that and have the life I wanted. I made a vow never to apologize for who I am, what I desire, or how I feel.</strong></p>
<p>And all my relationships, with friends, family, my fiance, and myself, improved immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Apologies are fine when you've <em>done</em> something wrong.</strong></p>
<p>But that's just the thing: you have to have done some wrong or hurtful <em>action</em>.</p>
<p>Apologizing for the way you are is a recipe for self-destruction. To admit fault for being a certain way, or wanting certain things, is to tell yourself that there is something fundamentally unworkable about who you are.</p>
<p>This pits you at war with yourself, and being apologetic for what you believe in is the exact opposite of what you need to be an effective, inspiring, leader.</p>
<p>Apology is the opposite of authenticity. Apology is defensive and unsure, while authenticity is forthright and confident.</p>
<p><strong>People look for authenticity and confidence in their leaders, not apology.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there are <a href="http://stress.about.com/od/relationshipskills/a/The-Importance-Of-Apologizing.htm" target="_blank">times when an apology is warranted</a> and expected. Those times are when you DO or SAY something that hurts another person, breaks a promised agreement, or at least seriously inconveniences them.</p>
<p>And it's not about the word, "I'm sorry," either. It's about the attitude of apology and using it in the right circumstances.</p>
<p>Sometimes "I'm sorry" is an expression of empathy or a clever way to manage a social tangle, just as you can be apologetic without actually saying, "I'm sorry." <em><a href="http://elitedaily.com/women/saying-sorry-for-women/1101398/" target="_blank">This article</a> does a great job of explaining what is an apology and what isn't</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I'll be honest, this isn't easy. There are still times I find myself apologizing for something I don't need to. If I catch it, I sometimes try to rephrase it, or I just go with it and stay mindful.</p>
<p>But being determined to be authentic, and no apologetic, about who I am and my vision for my life and the world, has definitely shifted how I hold myself and deal with others.</p>
<p>So, if you'd like to try this new perspective on, here are the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never apologize to yourself or others for who you are, what you desire, or how you feel.</li>
<li>Do apologize for actions or words that hurt others or inconvenience them (even then, I prefer to use "pardon" or "excuse me").</li>
<li>Apologize when you fail to live up to a commitment, promise, or agreement.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's that simple.</p>
<p>- K***</p>
<p>PS: By the way, I'm also saying don't apologize for feeling apologetic. If that's who you are, embrace it, IF it is helping you be the person you want to be. It wasn't helping me, so I looked for a way to grow past it.</p>
