<p><em></em><a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/porto.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1662" title="porto" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/porto-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>My girlfriend and I just returned from a nine day trip to  Portugal, in which we stayed at the Sheraton Lisboa, a number of  hostels, toured Lisbon and Porto for two days each, and spent two days  at the fishing village of Peniche. We ate really, really well (a little  too well actually), usually at restaurants with a few home-cooked meals.  We took trams and buses and trains all over the place, and spent a day  exploring an island off the coast. We also spent a day in Barcelona,  Spain, on our way to Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>And we did is all for $1525 per person</strong>. Considering  how poorly we managed our money, I think that is a pretty good deal,  and it includes all incidentals. The cost of airfare getting to Portugal  and back was only $725 per person, and accommodation was less than $200  per person for the whole trip. If you cooked more of your own meals at  hostels, or weren’t so ditzy about navigating public transportation,  your incidentals would have been lower than ours (about $600).</p>
<p>Considering that I am only occasionally employed, it seems that if we can make this happen, anyone should be able to do it too.</p>
<p>Since this seems ridiculously affordable, I thought I’d share how we did it.<!--more--></p>
<h2><strong>Getting Cheap Tickets</strong></h2>
<p>The first trick was of course getting to Portugal. Flights  direct to Lisbon run about $1200+ per person for a round trip ticket.  Instead of booking that way, we decided to work the system a little bit.</p>
<p>I had discovered, through the great resources at <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/"><em>The Art of Non-Conformity</em></a>,  that the various airlines offer deals to select destinations on their  websites. These deals don’t come up on the flight search engines like  Kayak. So we simply waited until the week before our trip to see what  American Airlines would offer.</p>
<p>Sure enough, an offer for a $250 one-way trip to Barcelona  came up. Total round trip fare with fees and taxes: $625. That’s a bit  more than half the usual fare on Kayak or Orbitz.</p>
<p>Of course, now we had to actually get to Lisbon. Also  thanks to AoNC, I had learned that Europe has really good budget  airlines. So I booked a flight on <a href="http://easyjet.com/">EasyJet.com</a> from Barcelona to Lisbon for $50. I was pretty astounded at the prices for those flights, but it wasn’t a deal or anything.</p>
<p>The one thing I think that really helped with planning  this was our relative flexibility. Because we didn’t have any specific  dates - just an approximate week-long period - we were able to take  advantage of AA’s fare special and any deals that might come up with the  budget carriers. Of course, we shopped around, but the only other  airline with cheaper fares from Spain to Portugal was RyanAir, and  sometimes, I’m willing to pay a bit extra for better service.</p>
<h2><strong>Accommodations</strong></h2>
<p>Thanks to my American Express Starwoods Preferred Guest  credit card, and the points I’d accrued on it, we were able to spend two  nights at the Sheraton Lisboa for the cost of my points plus $60/night.  That turned out to be less per person than it cost to stay at the  hostels. The Sheraton was our cheapest accommodation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was also the least welcoming or comfortable, but that’s life I guess.</p>
<p>Generally, of course, hostels are a better deal than  hotels, so we saved a bit of money that way. The only way we could have  done better is to have used <a href="http://couchsurfers.com/">Couchsurfers.com</a>. As it was, we relied on a friend of my sister’s, whose family hosted us for two nights in Peniche.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Tips and Tricks</strong></h2>
<p>Some other ways we saved a little cash:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We made our own food</strong> at a hostel one night.  This came out to about half the cost of a restaurant meal, and provided  food for our next two meals as well. Also included a bottle of wine.</li>
<li><strong>Used our student cards</strong> to get into some museums.</li>
<li><strong>Took the bus instead of the train</strong>. This didn’t save a ton of money, but it was a little cheaper.</li>
<li><strong>Stayed with a friend’s family in Peniche</strong>. This  saved us food costs as well as accommodation, and also helped us put our  incidental money to best use because they were able to recommend the  best activities in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Traveled really light</strong>. EasyJet charges for any  checked luggage, so we only carried backpacks. This gave us more  flexibility, less to worry about, and less to carry around. We didn’t  miss anything (other than my laptop, which I replaced with my iPad,  which explains why I didn’t post much…sorry).</li>
<li><strong>Stayed off the beaten track</strong>. Generally, we  tried to eat away from the tourist areas, which wasn’t always possible  or practical. If we needed basic sundries, we went to the supermarket,  where we could get a 2L water bottle for .90 euros, instead of for 3.</li>
<li><strong>Skipped Meals</strong>. We actually didn’t intend to do  this, but because of messed up sleeping patterns, we missed breakfast  our first two days. The result was that we only ate two meals for  several days we were traveling. I think we ended up compensating for  this with lots of pastries, but that’s not really necessary either.</li>
<li><strong>Used public transportation</strong>. Don’t use taxis. We  used one once. It was a mistake. Public transportation is so much  cheaper. Just make sure to take time to understand where you’re going  and budget extra time for navigating.</li>
<li><strong>Used the day passes</strong>. Porto offered a tourist  card that provided free public transportation for one day. Lisbon also  offered a day pass for her public transportation system. Just two round  trips made these cards worth it, and it saved us the hassle of digging  through our pockets for change every time we needed to go somewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest thing I learned from this trip was that travel  is relatively affordable if you do it right. The travel industry tries  to make it seem like it is necessary to spend a lot of money (probably  because most of that money ends up in someone’s pocket), but you can do  pretty well without worrying about all the extra stuff.</p>
<p><strong>So if you want to travel, there really is nothing stopping you.</strong></p>
<p>Also, a big thanks to Chris Guillebeau and his blog, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/"><em>The Art of Non-Conformity</em></a>.  I got 80% of my travel tips and hacks from various of his articles and  ebooks (sadly, I’m not an affiliate, so I don’t get money if you buy any  of them, but they’re still really insightful and useful).</p>
