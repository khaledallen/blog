<p><a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/humbledog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2843" alt="SONY DSC" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/humbledog.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a>The theme of this year is definitely <a title="Empower Yourself Through Humility" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empower-yourself-through-humility/">humility</a>.</p>
<p>I have this annoying habit of questioning authority in all its forms, even when it's authority I normally support, i.e., my MovNat trainers at my <a title="Playing in the Woods, Mountain Lions, and Braised Chicken" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/playing-in-the-woods-mountain-lions-and-braised-chicken/">recent certification</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop was well run and everyone got a lot out of it, but at one point, I found something to pick on and made a big deal out of nothing. I realize, looking back, that I had primed myself for a confrontation by the attitude I brought in to the certification, which was one of proving myself rather than learning something.</p>
<p>After it all went down, I was pretty upset, not so much with the trainers, who handled it very professionally, but with myself for being bothered and for feeling the need to do or say anything. After all, it wasn't <em>my </em>workshop, nor was it my responsibility. I spent a troubled evening losing sleep and <strong>trying to figure out what it was inside me that was causing me so much anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out it was the desire to prove myself rather than let go and simply learn. I reached out to my sister for advice, and she wisely suggested <strong>I make a distinction between observation (learning) and judging (reacting)</strong>. So, the next morning, after a sincere and humbling apology (damage control), I made a point of simply observing and withholding judgement for the remaining three days.</p>
<p><strong>Needless to say, I learned a lot more that way than with my original approach.<!--more--><!--more--></strong></p>
<h3>Add Nothing</h3>
<p>This realization sits well with my understanding of Buddhist psychology: <strong>there is a difference between an event an our reaction to it</strong>. Fear, anger, pride, disdain, joy: all of these are responses to things in the world, and they are not inherent in the world itself.</p>
<p>If we realize this, we can take a step back and avoid getting swept up in our emotions. Keeping this truth in mind allows us to take an active role in deciding how we respond to situations, since we are the ones who get to choose what our response it.</p>
<p>This allows us to make some pretty awesome steps in growth. Where normally we might respond with outrage when someone cuts us off in traffic, we can instead observe (respond physically by avoiding an accident), decide not to ruin our morning with anger, and get to work calm and focused.</p>
<p>Instead of responding with fear or anger when our loved one brings up a concern in the relationship, we can listen (which alone might do a lot of good), observe and learn, and formulate a response grounded in solving our mutual needs and desires. The first response can end in a breakup, while the second can lead to increased commitment and closeness.</p>
<p><strong>We get to choose</strong>.</p>
<h3>Lesson Applied</h3>
<p>I had the chance to apply this lesson very soon after I learned it.</p>
<p>I am offering movement training in exchange for business consulting with a friend. When he started talking to me about my perception of jobs and financial stability, I realized that business consulting involved much more than simply discussing action plans and marketing ideas.</p>
<p>At first, I got really defensive, but he pointed out that we were trying to come to a joint solution on my issue, not impose his way of doing things on my life (he also told me bluntly not to get defensive, which served as a good reminder). I was aware of how agitated I was getting, but I was also aware that I <em>wanted </em>his advice.</p>
<p>So, instead of cutting him off at every opportunity, I tried to sit and listen and just learn.</p>
<p>I'll admit, it was really hard, and I certainly have a lot to work on, but by recognizing that my commitment to growing was more important than my need to defend my worldview (which wasn't really under attack anyway), we were able to come up with a perspective and a plan that clarified my goals and needs and communicated his ideas.</p>
<p>Basically, we reached a point of collaboration rather than descending into an argument. We could have left that meeting frustrated with only half a plan, but we were able to leave with a new sense of connection and a solid roadmap to how I can get on my feet financially.</p>
