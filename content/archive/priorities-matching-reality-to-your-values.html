<p><em>Upon returning from my trip to Utah, I've found myself caught in a whirlwind of activity, trying to catch up with all sorts of projects. This hasn't given me time to act on the important things that are normally part of my routine, nor the amazing insights I gained in the desert of the Canyonlands. That's one reason this post is late. It is a pattern I've noticed in myself before, when I lived in Korea and was trying to establish a match between the life and wanted and the life I ended up living.</em></p>
<p>Every now and then, it's good to take stock of how closely the life you're actually living matches the life you want to be living. Are the things that are important to you getting their due, or are they just sitting on the back burner, day after day?</p>
<p><strong>I find that stress tends to lead me to give up on my routines and plans with the excuse of surviving or making do.</strong></p>
<p>It's like that saying about putting your head down and plowing through. You don't know (or don't want to know) where you're going, you just need to get through whatever's in front you, as fast as possible, without regard to finesse or tact.</p>
<p><strong>But the problem with doing that is that sometimes you move forward only to look up to find yourself somewhere you didn't mean to go</strong>. Then you've got to go back or find another way. You've wasted effort.</p>
<p>Or worse, because you haven't taken the time to plot your course, you end up barreling into another crisis situation, and the only way to deal with that is to do the same thing that got you there in the first place. Then, you become a slave to events, moving in the direction set by each crisis. At first, you are just telling yourself, "I just need to get through this week, then everything will be back on track." But when that week passes, you haven't taken the time to set your course, and it becomes another week or 'getting through,' then another, then another, until you find yourself lost.<!--more--><!--more--></p>
<h3>Your Heart is Where you Spend Your Time</h3>
<p>There is another saying about working smart, not hard, to apply your effort where it matters (<a title="Book Review: The 80/20 Principle" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/">see the 80/20 Principle</a>).</p>
<p>Here in Boulder, I've found that it is very easy to get lost in the daily grind, to keep my head down and just try to get by, only to find that I'm not living the life I came here to live in the first place. It's not that I <a title="Did You Forget Why You Came This Way?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/did-you-forget-why-you-came-this-way/">forget my values</a>, but simply that I don't make them a priority.</p>
<p>The things that I value most aren't getting the attention they deserve, based on how much they mean to me. This is a recipe for self-dissatisfaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I want to write, yet I rarely write more than a couple blog posts a week anymore.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I want to train movement, parkour, and self-defense, yet I'm lucky to get three hours a week.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Spending time in nature is one reason I moved in Boulder, but I don't make time to go on hikes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">There is time in the mornings to meditate, but I never actually take advantage of it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I hold these things close to my heart -- writing, movement training, nature, spirituality -- yet as they say in economics, the true test of what matters to people is where they spend their money and their time. So either I have to admit that these things are not as important to me as handling the day-to-day, or I need to rearrange my days to incorporate more of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">There are some things that I value which get lots of attention.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Spending time with A during the day and sharing dinner in the evening.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Contributing to the coworking space I'm a part of.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Being a part of the local food scene in Boulder.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Gardening.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are things I want to be doing, rather than things that need to get done.</strong> I get a lot of satisfaction from including them in my life, and based on that, <strong>I really do think it is extremely important to try to make our lives align with our values</strong>. It may take a lot of work, but it seems the simplest way to be happy.</p>
<h3>It All Comes Down to Integrity</h3>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">First, you have to have </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" title="The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/">awareness</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> of what matters to you. This can take a lot of soul-searching, or it can simply be a matter of being attentive to the things that evoke emotions in you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Second, you have to practice </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" title="Be Like a River: Live with Intention" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/be-like-a-river-live-with-intention/">intentional living</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">. Be the one making the decisions in your life. Put in the work to make sure your life is built the way you want it.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">These two together lead to </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" title="The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-meaning-of-integrity-the-complete-human/">integrity of being</a><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">, where your outer life is an expression of your inner values. Maintaining integrity is the great balancing act, though, and it provides constant feedback to adjust your intentions and to check your awareness.</span></li>
</ol>
