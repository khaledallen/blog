<p>“Every human being has hundreds of separate people living under his skin. The talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living with him.” - Mel Brooks</p></blockquote>
<p>I was standing on the train platform on my way into New York when a young girl standing with her mother looked over and asked me, "Are you a writer?"</p>
<p>I have never been asked this before. Normally, if people see me carrying my journal, they ask if I write, but not if I am myself a 'writer'. But this girl thought I looked like a writer, with my long hair, unshaven beard, and worn leather jacket. Or maybe it was the classically creative look of my Moleskine journal (thank you Moleskine, I will never make fun of your pretentiousness again).</p>
<p>The question left me speechless for a moment. I was almost suspicious, as if the girl had asked me, "Would you like an extra $500?" The first thing you want is to say yes, but it just seems too easy.<!--more--></p>
<p>I did say yes. It felt amazing to own up to my <a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/what-do-you-call-yourself/" target="_self">self-declared identity</a>. I told her I mostly write online, via blogs and such. She proceeded to quiz me on what my future writing endeavors were, and I told her I wanted to be a novelist. "What kind of novels would you write?" This was too good to be true! I almost went into a rant about my science fiction epic, but the train arrived, sparing her and her mother.</p>
<h2>Looking the Part</h2>
<p>I was so elated for the rest of the day. I felt like the world had gotten around to acknowledging what I'd been working to realize. Of course, an actual piece of published work would be a better acknowledgement, but this was hinting that I at least fit the part. I don't feel like writers really ever look like they work in literature. Construction workers have their hardhats, police officers have their uniforms, bankers even have their power ties and briefcases. Writers just wear whatever they feel like. But maybe we give off a certain vibe.</p>
<p>I was a little surprised at my reaction at first. I was still afraid to admit that I am a writer, because it doesn't mean much these days. Except that the girl said it with such admiration. I think that there is still some cache associated with being called a writer, even when everybody blogs and can share their ideas, in this world where actors and TV personalities get far more exposure. Writers are the workers of our cultural foundations in literature, those who manipulate the words that underly everything we talk and think about.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm reading too much into this. Whatever it's signficance, it felt good.</p>
