<p>The sustainable food blog, <a href="http://www.zacharyadamcohen.com/farmtotable/" target="_blank">Farm to Table</a>, has recently been declared a failure by its creator. The initial goal, to set up a foundation for a TV show, did not produce results, and so he has decided to cut his losses and pursue another (really interesting) project. Never one to let things lie, I offered to take over and take Farm to Table in a new direction.</p>
<p>So now I am the editor of Farm to Table, responsible for setting its direction and collaborating with the 1,000 or so followers. It's a big task, and I'm a little intimidated, but like most big tasks in life, I know there are ways to get a handle on it. As long as I don't put too much pressure on myself to master things right away, give myself the room to make mistakes and grow into the new role, I am confident that I can step up and become a leader in the sustainable food community.</p>
<p>Zach has done a huge amount of work building up Farm to Table and establishing a large following. I have a responsibility to that community, but I don't want to be so afraid of messing up a great thing that I fail to take the risks necessary to move it in a new direction. I see the blog as a very influential source of information and collaboration in the sustainable food world, and I want to capitalize on that influence and use it to make real change. I see a lot of untapped potential, and I know that there is plenty of passion and drive in the sustainable food community to unlock that potential. I have always been a firm believer that the greatest achievements in life are accomplished by groups of people, and I seem to have developed a knack for inspiring and organizing people, so I will rely on the energy of the community to drive this new project.</p>
<p>If there were ever anything worth fighting for change in, it is the American food system. So here I am, taking up the struggle, holding up a placard, stepping up to the front lines. Something I never really anticipated myself doing. But as I've said before, a Warrior is defined in service to some higher goal. For the time being, that goal seems to have found me, and I know I would be letting myself down if I did not answer that call, something I contemplated briefly before I made the offer to take over.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to contribute, let me know. We are looking for stories, restaurant reviews, farm tours, anything really. Also, if you have a knack for web sites and web design, that could be handy to.</p>
