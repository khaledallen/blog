<p>“As long as we are persistence in our pursuit of our deepest destiny, we will continue to grow. We cannot choose the day or time when we will fully bloom. It happens in its own time.” --Denis Waitley</p></blockquote>
<p>I know I haven’t posted to Warrior Spirit in a very long time. My concern was that the topic of the blog was becoming too vague and nebulous. I aspire to write stories for adventure magazines and grand science-fiction epics, neither of which were things this blog showcased.</p>
<p>Besides that, I haven’t found Warrior Spirit to be especially rewarding. There is very little community interaction on the blog. Articles don’t get shared often, nobody links to the blog, and I don’t get many comments. Sometimes I felt like I was writing in a vacuum.</p>
<p>So I decided to put it to rest and focus on other, more concrete projects.</p>
<p><strong>Then, I received a direct request to continue Warrior Spirit</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<p>That was really awesome, to have someone specifically ask that I write for them.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided to do that. After all, if anything I am doing is bringing value to other people, I would like to contribute as much as possible.</p>
<p>That said, I realize Warrior Spirit needs to be more focused. In the coming weeks, I’ll be reworking the purpose of the blog, the article topics, and perhaps the writing style a little bit.</p>
<p>It will remain a blog about the path of self-discovery within the self, along the lines of <a title="Four Books that Changed my Life this Summer" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/">Joseph Campbell’s mythic journey</a> paradigm.</p>
<p>I’ll probably cut back to one or two articles a week, so I can keep up with my other projects and my new job in South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for the support, and I hope I can continue inspiring you to follow your dreams and grow your spirit.</strong></p>
