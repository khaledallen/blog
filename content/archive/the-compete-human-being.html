<blockquote>
<p>“A  human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,  butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance  accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give  orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem,  pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently,  die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” - Lazarus Long<span><br />

<p>Joseph Campbell pointed out in his book <em>Myths to Live By </em>that,  as humans have become more and more specialized, they have started to  feel like bigger and bigger chunks of their being are empty. When all  you are comfortable doing is studying and researching and you can’t feel  capable in the physical or social realm, you discover big areas of life  completely closed off to you.<!--more--></p>
<p>Since the dawn of civilization, humans have been  specializing their skills. Instead of one individual being master to  every major skill in a cultural group, we became content to allow others  to take care of some of our needs. With the development of cities, we  had people who spent their entire lives mastering the intricacies of  organization and logistics and who depended on others to provide them  with food. Craftsmen in turn provided farmers with tools that they  couldn’t make for themselves.</p>
<p>As our civilization developed, we as individuals moved  more and more towards specialization. Whereas in the past, even an  aristocrat might have a basic understanding of the processes of growing  food by virtue of the fact that he owned farmland, nowadays food  production has become an extremely technical trade. The vast majority of  people in the developed world do not grow their own food, nor do they  really have a realistic grasp of the process of eating something they  produce themselves.</p>
<p>I’m also surprised at how many people do not have a  realistic grasp of the process of exercising their own bodies. I am a  trainer, so I benefit from the fact that people are willing to pay me to  tell them how to exercise, but it seems to me that a human being should  know basic self-care. Exercise isn’t that mystical. The fitness  industry makes it seem that way, so we think we have to pay a  professional to tell us how to do pushups. The result is that we never  develop a self-assessment ability and can’t self-correct our own  pushups. We instead come to rely entirely on feedback from other people.</p>
<h2><strong>A Little Bit of Everything</strong></h2>
<p>I have always believed in the value of a wide and  shallow—rather than a narrow and deep—skill set. I feel that I have been  well served by having a little bit of experience in a lot of different  things. I did the college academic thing, but I also got really good at  fitness and exercise. I flew planes for a bit, learned how to SCUBA  dive, can drive a car and a pickup truck, have lived in cities and used  public transportation, and have spent enough time in airports to know  some of the tricks of frequent fliers. I can cook for myself, am  comfortable eating at cheap places, and know the etiquette for eating at  the really fancy places. I can camp. I study martial arts to know how  to fight. I study Parkour to know how to run away. I study psychology to  know how to avoid trouble in the first place. I spent a bit of time  dating around, but have also had several long-term, committed  relationships. I know how to teach myself, know how to critically  analyze a book or an article, and know how to craft my own arguments.</p>
<p>I like to think that my life is pretty holistic, but I  know that there are still a lot of holes to fill. I’ve never grown my  own food, and I am still pretty clueless when it comes to metalwork and  computer programming. I only mention these because they are things I’d  like to learn. I know the basic concepts.</p>
<h2><strong>The Adaptable Warrior</strong></h2>
<p>My concept of a Warrior has always been someone with a  very wide skill set. I have to be able to handle any situation that  comes my way. I don’t have to be a master of whatever I deal with, but I  have to be good enough that I can get by.</p>
<p>One of my favorite heroes exemplifies this approach very well. <a title="Mythic Warriors: Link" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/mythic-warriors-link/">Link</a>, the hero of the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>series  of video games, is notable for his fighting prowess, his ability to  solve wicked puzzles, and his courage and compassion. He is as handy  with a sword as he is with a fishing rod, and plays a mean ocarina. I  was always impressed by the fact that, compared to many other adventure  heroes, Link had the ability to apply such a wide range of skills to any  given situation. So often, an adventure hero simply destroys every  obstacle in his path, or the game conveniently makes violence a  universal solution.</p>
<h2><strong>Master the Essentials</strong></h2>
<p>Obviously, there is a lot to master in life. To keep  things simple, I only ask of myself that I be able to deal with the  essentials. I should be able to get myself anywhere I need to be, I  should be able to feed myself healthy, tasty food, provide myself with  friends and contribute to my social groups, and I should know how my  body and mind work on a basic level. I should also be capable of  grasping and analyzing whatever situations I find myself in, follow  whatever I read, and hold my own in an argument.</p>
<p>Outside of those general requirements, I pretty much let myself do what I enjoy.</p>
