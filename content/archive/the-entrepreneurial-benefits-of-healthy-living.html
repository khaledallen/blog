  of all the ways staying healthy can help you succeed in work and life.

<p>I've noticed an interesting trend among ambitious businesspeople: a tendency to neglect their health.</p>
<p>They seem to think that they can get away with treating their bodies poorly. In the pursuit of success, they end up pulling all-nighter after all-nighter, eating cheap, quick junk food to get back to work as soon as possible, drinking tons of coffee, and spending hours hunched over the keyboard.</p>
<p>I've been in those kinds of situations, and I admire their dedication, but I've also come to learn that a weak body leads to a weak mind. <strong>The most successful entrepreneurs I know of take care of themselves</strong>. They exercise, they eat well, and they make sure they get enough sleep. They have learned that a belief in their own value is necessary, and part of that means investing in self-care.Â <a title="Brendan Burchard" href="http://www.brendonburchard.com/">This guy</a> even bases his entire course around empowering self-care.</p>
<p>There hasn't been a lot about exercise, fitness, and health on Warrior Spirit lately. I got a little burned out. <strong>But that doesn't mean those things aren't a central part of what it takes to live with courage</strong>. You need to have a strong body to <a title="5 Ways to Boost Your Courage Right Now!" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/5-ways-to-boost-your-courage-right-now/">feel confident</a> and clear. Your clarity and confidence is dependent on your health.</p>
<p>I'm not saying being as healthy as possible is all you need. It definitely is not. But it is one necessary component.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being healthy sends the message to yourself that you believe in your own value. <strong>This will help you act more confident</strong>.</li>
<li>An appearance of health and being put together <strong>leads others to treat you with respect</strong>.</li>
<li>Health leads to <strong>sharp, incisive thinking and creative ideas</strong>.</li>
<li>It allows you to <strong>work harder and longer</strong>.</li>
<li>It helps you feel better, which makes you <strong>optimistic and forward-thinking</strong>.</li>
<li>Being habitually healthy means you can <strong>rely upon a certain baseline of energy</strong> and you <strong>won't be sidetracked by minor illness.</strong></li>
<li>Health and strength gives us <strong>a</strong> <strong>feeling of being able to overcome obstacles</strong>, which directly translates to success in life.</li>
</ul>
