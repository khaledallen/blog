excerpt: What would your life have to be like for you to consider yourself a hero?

<p>What does heroism mean to you?</p>
<p>For some people, heroism is about showing up for their families. Maybe you make a comfortable income, but getting home late and never having the chance to tuck your kids into bed makes you feel empty and hollow.</p>
<p>For others, it's the other way around: you take care of the home and family, but you want to have a bigger impact in the wider community.</p>
<p>Other people want to feel heroic about their personal efficacy. They read about ultra-marathons and watch videos of acrobats and yearn to develop those skills, to test themselves.</p>
<p>Some want to learn how to be great at chess, or a sport, or they want to expand their skill set through education and experience. Others want to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have a cause you believe in, and making a difference in that would make you feel heroic.</p>
<p>To me, it means supporting others in creating their dreams, believing in them, and setting an example of personal excellence.</p>
<p><strong>It is having faith and taking action in support of the belief that anyone, anywhere, can realize their dreams and be historically significant in their communities and the lives of those they care about.</strong> It's about empowering people, in whatever ways I can. When I started this blog, all I could do was share my story and hope it inspired. Then, I taught people how to create strong, energetic, vibrantly healthy bodies.</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on a new approach. It's about helping people realize their heroism in their business and worldly affairs. There's a lot of overlap with health and psychology, but I've come to the conclusion that money, finances, and how you conduct yourself in business are simply reflections of personal and social value (whether real or perceived).</p>
<p>The project is called The Everyday Hero (working title). You'll probably see hints of it cropping up on my main URL, and when it launches, you can expect an invite. I'm not sure if it will supplant Warrior Spirit or coexist, but there will probably be some inconsistency with WS posts while I'm getting TEH up and running.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone has their own definition of heroism, and all of them are worth realizing. My mission in life is to help them realize it.</strong></p>
