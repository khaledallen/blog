excerpt: It's not that the question is hard to answer. It's that the answer is hard
  to face. Sometimes, it's easier to suffer than admit a fault.

<p dir="ltr">He hated his job. The sterile thin air that assaulted him as soon as he walked into his office made him sick, and he was on edge until the minute he finally went home. He couldn’t stand his boss, didn’t have any friends among his co-workers, and found his job tedious. It was even affecting his life outside of work: it took him hours to unwind and he winced every time his phone chimed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His wife knew how bad it was for him, but the one time she had brought it up, he refused to talk about it, instead picking a fight. It wasn’t worth the anger, she decided, but she couldn’t stand watching him suffer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One day, he came home in a rage, railing against his incompetent boss and some problem his wife couldn’t follow. She calmed him down, but then he just beat up on himself for not being able to handle the situation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, exasperated, she asked, “Why do you stay? Why do you put yourself through this?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The automatic answer that almost escaped his lips was, “For us! I do this so we can live a comfortable life!” But he knew that wasn’t the real reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A part of him knew the real answers. They had to do with winning his father’s respect, with his fear of starting over, with the fact that his sense of identity was tied up with his work. He knew the real reasons had nothing to do with ‘being a good partner’ or ‘supporting his family’. <strong>The real reasons were all things he didn’t want to believe were true about himself.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">So he never asked himself the hard questions that would bring the real reasons to light.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It was easier to suffer, he decided, than to admit he had made a mistake.<!--more--></strong></p>
<h3>You Already Know the Answer You Seek</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Hard questions. They aren’t hard because the answer is difficult to figure out, like the advanced SAT questions I help kids solve. <strong>No, the ‘hard’ part of these questions is that we already know the answers, but we don’t want to face the implications</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We all have some hard questions nagging us. Maybe we’ve put off answering them because we don’t want to deal with the truth right now. Perhaps it’s not the right time, and we’ll deal with them when things are more settled, says the little demon of self-deception riding on your shoulder.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But when will that be? How long has it ‘not been the right time’? How long have you been waiting for things to be ‘more settled’? Or are things so crazy right now because of the very question you’re avoiding?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The truth is, the questions we avoid will force the issue by causing stress. You can't escape them or put them off without consequence.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ignoring these questions, and the answers they demand, is just what the little monsters want. It's your personal dragon sowing chaos in your life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your partner always seems to be stressed out, so you don’t want to rock the boat by bringing up the question, “Is this relationship benefitting us?” Of course, maybe he or she is stressed out because of these very concerns. By appeasing, you’re just treating the symptoms, not the cause.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or maybe things are fine. It’s smooth sailing but there’s no <a title="When Life Gets in the Way, What do You Do?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/when-life-gets-in-the-way-what-do-you-do/">real progress</a>. You go out for your run every morning, but you’re not getting any faster or running any farther. You’re not getting closer to your fitness goals. Do you question if you should change things up? Or do you remain ignorant, stubbornly sticking to your routine, <a title="Why We Avoid Pursuing Our Dreams, and 3 Strategies to Get Motivated" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-we-avoid-pursuing-our-dreams-and-3-strategies-to-get-motivated/">putting off your dreams</a> by simply going through the motions? This is a very different kind of demon: the demon of mediocrity.</p>
<h3>A Marker of the Need to Grow</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The hard questions are the ones we need to deal with to move forward in life. When they are lingering unanswered, we are stuck.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">They are so hard to swallow because they usually revolve around admitting that <a title="You’re Not the One Who Will Achieve Your Dreams" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/youre-not-the-one-who-will-achieve-your-dreams/">the person we are now needs to change</a>, and change is scary.</p>
<p>Why is this so painful? Why aren’t things going well?</p>
<p>Luckily, hard questions give us a clue as to what we need to work on within ourselves. They tell us where our <a title="6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/">weaknesses</a> are. <strong>Fear is the dragon keeping us from our true potential. We can pretend we don't care what it's guarding, but the very fact that it exists means it's keeping something valuable from us. <a title="How I Turn Fear into Inspiration" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-i-turn-fear-into-inspiration/">Seek it out and slay it</a>.</strong><a title="How I Turn Fear into Inspiration" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-i-turn-fear-into-inspiration/"><br />
