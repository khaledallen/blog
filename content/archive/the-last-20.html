<p><em>What distinguishes the good from the great? At what point do you go from being alright to being amazing?</em></p>
<p>I think that the answer to that question is related to how insistent you are on rising past 'good enough' to 'awesome.' For most things in life, 80% is good enough to get by, so most people stop at 80%:</p>
<ul>
<li>You eat right 80% of the time</li>
<li>You are 80% committed to your exercise program, but if something comes up, you're happy to skip a day</li>
<li>You are happy getting A- grades</li>
<li>You follow up with potential leads 80% of the time</li>
<li>You listen with 80% of your attention, 80% of the time</li>
</ul>
<p>In truth, that's fine. For most areas of life, that's all you need. Trying to be 100% in everything would be exhausting. It would require superhuman powers of discipline, scheduling, and sheer determination.</p>
<p><strong>So you know I'm going to say GO FOR IT!<!--more--></strong></p>
<h3>The Home Stretch</h3>
<p>Getting to 80% is relatively easy. It's not a walk in the park, but it's doable. As long as you're willing to make a small commitment, it's within reach.</p>
<p><strong>But that last 20% is really hard</strong>. Getting from 80%-85% is significantly harder than 60%-80%, and 85%-90%, or 90%-95% is almost unimaginably difficult. That last 5% seems totally impossible, and in truth it probably requires a combination of full commitment, exceptional skill and talent, good mentors, experience, and some luck.</p>
<p><strong>So the real question becomes, "Is it worth it?"</strong></p>
<p>The answer depends on what you expect from life.</p>
<p>Do you expect a life that transcends the norm?</p>
<p>If so, then you'll have to go beyond the norms to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Conflicting Interests</h3>
<p>But what happens when you have two areas of life that conflict? You can't be 100% committed to your job AND your son's baseball games, can you?</p>
<p><strong>My thinking here is that part of being 100% committed to life includes arranging it so you CAN.</strong></p>
<p>In the above example, the answer would be to establish professional and familial expectations that don't conflict with one another. That might mean taking a different job that you can actually be 100% involved in.</p>
<p>I understand the realities are not always so simple.</p>
<p><strong>But aiming for the ideal, while accepting and working with the reality, is always a better strategy than settling for less.</strong></p>
<p>Don't live with your volume at half. Figure out how to live your life in full 5.1 surround sound. If that means watching fewer channels, that might be the way to go.</p>
