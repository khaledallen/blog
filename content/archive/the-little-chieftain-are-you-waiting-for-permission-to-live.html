  Do you? Is this holding you back from playing a bigger game?

<p><a href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2834" alt="The Chief's Headdress" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>The once was a tribe of people living in an ancient land. They chose from among their number one to lead them, a chief, who was the most skilled in hunting, diplomacy, and wisdom. He or she was to be a beacon for the tribe, a person to inspire a sense of belonging and security.</p>
<p>One year, as the current chief was dying, there were two candidates to replace her. Both boys were truly skilled in the art of warriorship, and both possessed wisdom beyond their years. They were of the same age, at the cusp of manhood, but one still acted like a little boy. He felt like someone or something had to give him permission to be a man. The other acted as if manhood were already his. He took an air of fatherhood around the children and acted like an equal among the elders.</p>
<p>Despite this, the tribe still had trouble deciding, for both boys were exceptionally skilled and passed all the tests of intellect and insight. After a long day being interviewed, the two of them found themselves alone in the chief's room, the elders having retired to discuss. Sitting in the back of the room were the chieftain's robes and headdress.</p>
<p>As boys are wont to do, they grew curious about that which is forbidden them, and finally they decided try on these magical garments. They had been fashioned for an adult, and clearly would fit neither boy, but they wanted to feel what it would be like.</p>
<p>The first boy threw the robe around his scrawny shoulders and lowered the headdress over his brow. His friend only barely managed to stifle a laugh, and truly the boy in the robes felt strange and uncomfortable. He hunched, as if trying to get away from the feathers that adorned his head. They robes didn't fit, physically or otherwise, but he assumed they would feel more comfortable over time, just as his bow had felt awkward until he had taken it on several hunts. He knew that if he were selected, the tribe's permission would give him the certainty he needed to fill the outfit.</p>
<p>Now the other boy donned the garb, and the large robe slipped down his narrow shoulders. But when the first boy looked on his friend smiling and standing tall under the too-large headdress, he saw that this boy wore the cloak and feathers like they were already his. The way he stood, the way he bore them proudly instead of uncertainly, said that he could already see himself as the chief. Perhaps there were skills to be learned, but this boy was not shy of being called chief and being looked to for guidance. Though the garb didn't fit physically, it seemed to belong to this boy.</p>
<p>The first boy told his friend what he saw and he left the room to tell the elders he was withdrawing. And the little chief who had always been a chief led his tribe on to many great victories.</p>

<p><a title="I’m Moving to Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/">Having arrived in Boulder</a>, I set about trying to establish a life here. Income was (is) hard to come by. I live in a shared apartment, and I've applied to a lot of part-time jobs to try to get things started.</p>
<p><a title="Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/">It's pretty scary sometimes</a>.</p>
<p>Then I met a guy, not even my age, who goes to work in a suit and tie, who owns his own condo, and who doesn't just work because he needs a bit of money as he sets up for his next step, but who is a contributing member of society.</p>
<p>I know I am quite mature in regards to psychology, emotional intelligence, and personal integrity, but <strong>in terms of my material prosperity, I still envision my life like a student, someone dependent, in transition.<!--more--></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I feel that the most appropriate living space is a student living arrangement: shared apartments, small spaces, roommates.</li>
<li>I expect only to do part-time work, unrelated to my larger world-changing goals.</li>
<li>I imagine making only enough money to get by, and despite complaints and efforts to the contrary, I expect money to be tight.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are definitely not things I <em>want,</em> but they are what I <em>expect</em>. <strong>I was waiting for life to give me permission to move up and play a bigger game.</strong></p>
<p>Even as I applied for jobs and planned out my future here, these assumptions guided what I thought was possible. They were self-limiting, though I thought I was just being pragmatic. But when I see people my age <em>living their lives</em>, I understand that our life truly is what we make of it.</p>
<p>When I realized I had these underlying assumptions, I took a moment to ask myself why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why shouldn't I aspire to own my own luxury condo in downtown Boulder? Why not make that a realistic expectation of my living situation? Not because it's fancy and worth showing off, but <strong>because I am worth it</strong>.</li>
<li>Why shouldn't I expect to make more money than I need? I have the skills and abilities to command several thousand a month, so why do I think $1500 is a great start?</li>
<li>Why not decide to be a big deal in this community? Why not accept that I could be a real game changer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to all these why's was simply that I was waiting for someone or something to say it was okay. I was <a title="Velvet Ropes" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/velvet-ropes/">living in the lines</a>, forgetting how limiting this is. I was waiting for some abstract entity to <em>grant </em>me a high-paying job (because apparently I wasn't getting one myself), which would give me permission to live in a better house, which would make me a 'significant person', etc.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, I realized that the assumptions underlying my material life were totally irrational, unreasonable, and generally wacked up. They didn't make sense, and really just gave me an excuse to avoid taking responsibility by playing a small game and living a marginal life.</strong></p>
<p>So, yeah, I'm just getting the ball rolling. I will rock this town!</p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
