<p>The problem with charging people for a service is that it limits who is worthy of being helped.</p>
<p>I've been in the position of being someone who is really passionate about learning a skill, and would make the perfect student, but who cannot afford something. It never felt fair because it suggests that only rich people can be skilled or learned or whatever.</p>
<p>If I believe that people will benefit from learning how to be more in-tune with their bodies, to move with power and grace, then presumably this applies to all people. However, if I charge a lot of money for it, then I'm saying that only people with plenty of disposable income are worth being helped, and I simply don't believe that.</p>
<p>If I don't charge a lot of money for it, then I'm devaluing myself and the importance of what I do.</p>
<p>I know I need to make a living in order to be able to survive so that I can continue to help people, but I can't make that reality fit with my sense that I'm excluding a large number of people who couldn't afford what I'd like to charge (or what I feel I deserve).</p>
<p><strong>How do people reconcile these two issues? Any advice or input would be really helpful right now.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I not diminish the value of what I offer, but instead find creative ways to help others meet that value. So, if someone doesn't have the money, ask if they have some other way that can fill the difference.</p>
<p>Possible ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Referrals: Instead of paying full price, they make up the difference with referrals. If they don't bring in enough referrals, they can't continue training.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Other services: Everyone's got some kind of expertise. Maybe they can offer something I need in exchange for training.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Access to networks: The opportunity to present my ideas in front of larger audiences is certainly a valuable exchange.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess it relates to having a sense of self-worth, which is ultimately the most important thing you can offer a community. Without it, you end up being consumed and sucked dry, left with nothing to offer. With it, you hold on to enough energy to continue giving.</p>
