  Treat yourself with respect, and others will follow.

<blockquote>“When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself.” -Mark Twain</p></blockquote>
<p>Life's eternal question: Do you gain self-respect when your worth is proven in the world, or do you prove your worth by cultivating honest self-respect? And can you fake it?</p>
<p>I've noticed a harmful trend in personal development literature, in every field from entrepreneurship to dating, recommending over-the-top confidence, arrogance, and sometimes outright lying. In an attempt to get shy quiet types like me to actually sell ourselves, these gurus assure us that pushy sales tactics are a perfectly legitimate way to interact with people. We need to get over our sqeamishness and man-up, whether it's bulldozing a client to close a deal or asserting dominance to 'pick up' a date.</p>
<p><strong>I disagree. I think that kind of arrogance is symptomatic of people who lack real confidence and so have to rely on a facade of bravado.</strong> There is certainly value in rehearsal, routines, and templates, but these should serve as a framework to human interaction, not the basis of them.</p>
<h3>Built-in BS Detector</h3>
<p>Don't think anyone can tell the difference? The human brain is really good at making judgement about other people based on subtle body language clues that give away a person's true character. For example, after watching a 30 second silent clip of a teacher interacting with a student, research subjects were able to predict how well the teacher would do on their evaluation at the end of the semester. Similar results were found with political candidates (2 seconds of exposure) and doctors facing malpractice suits.</p>
<p>The point is, we're really good at telling when people are inauthentic. (Whether we give credence to what we detect and actually act on our instinct is a matter of <a title="Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/">trusting your intuition</a>.)</p>
<h3>Fake It 'til You Make It</h3>
<p>On the other hand, I've also noticed that people tend to assume you have an accurate idea of your own value. That is, if you act like you're "kind of a big deal," they'll treat you that way unless circumstances prove otherwise (they may still challenge or test you to check if you're bluffing, so don't actually lie). <strong>If you act like you're not capable or worthy of respect and responsibility, others will treat you accordingly, even if you're actual accomplishments suggest otherwise</strong>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>In working with high school students preparing to take the ACT and SAT exams, I've noticed that the straight-A students frequently show more hesitation than their peers earning B's and C's. Most of the time, it's because they are very self-aware; they know better than the lower-scoring students how much they don't know.</p>
<p>Some can harness this awareness, but many suffer, constantly mired in second-guessing. They undermine themselves and send the message that they don't really believe in their own ability. I certainly wouldn't trust them with a task except for the fact that I know their test scores.</p>
<p>Many of my friends are like this: they are demonstrably smarter, wiser, more adaptable, determined, and effective than average, yet they act like they are far below average while people with a weaker track record but blind self-confidence (or good connections) earn all the good jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Which is why, in your quest to realize your greatest potential and attain mastery of the world around you, cultivating inner self-respect is essential, as is actually doing a good job, developing relationships, and having persistence.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There are no shortcuts to excellence.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Set high standards for yourself, and always do your best. Have an accurate assessment of your ability. If you did the first thing correctly, an 'accurate assessment' should mean you act confident.</p>
<p>Of course, being accurate is hard. It requires perspective. You must know your industry, your peers, and your competitors. That's the hard work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<h3>External Value</h3>
<p>You have demonstrated concretely that you are in fact valuable in terms that society measures. You have generated revenue for a company, or you have helped someone achieve results. You earned excellent grades or contributed to a groups' understanding of an issue.</p>
<p>The point is that you have generated results. There are concrete things in the world that exist because of you.</p>
<h3>Internal Value</h3>
<p>You believe you are worth knowing, worth investing in, and worth paying. You behave as if you deserve respect and attention. Not necessarily in a narcissistic way, but an assured way.</p>
<p>Internal value is something you assign yourself, and others will tend to treat you based on how you act.</p>
<p><strong>Do you treat yourself with the respect and consideration you'd like the world to offer you? If not, why are you waiting for someone else to <a title="The Little Chieftain; Are You Waiting for Permission to Live?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-little-chieftain-are-you-waiting-for-permission-to-live/">give you permission</a>?</strong></p>
<p>You've probably realized that there is a sort of feedback loop going on here: You act confident, so people respect you, which makes you feel even more confident, which leads to even more respect, which leads to even more confidence, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The trick is matching your internal value with your external value. You want people to give you responsibility in line with your ability (or slightly above, to spur growth) but not so much that you let them down. On the other hand, you don't want to act so modest that nobody is willing to hire you, ask your advice, or rely on you in any way.</p>
<h3>The Prince and the Pauper</h3>
<p>I struggled with this for a long time and expressed it through the way I dressed, which was generally very poorly. My excuse was that appearances were superficial, but the fact that I dressed myself in ratty clothes sent a very strong message to myself and others. It said, I'm not worth being comfortable and looking good.</p>
<blockquote><p>Actions speak louder than words, even when we're just talking with ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just imagine how you respond to an average unshaven guy in a sweatshirt and ragged jeans. Now, clean him up a bit and put him in an expensive suit. Totally different response. Even if you don't judge a book by its cover, you're still going to listen when this guy starts a conversation.</p>
<p>Well, I have recently started to dress well, which for me meant wearing clothes that fit, weren't torn, and didn't have random stains. The response has been blatant. People noticed right away, my financial situation has improved considerably because I've actually landed some clients, and I get treated more seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Do you engage in any behaviors that send the message you don't respect yourself? What changes can you make to start treating yourself with respect?</strong></p>
