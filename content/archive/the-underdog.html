<p>I am small.</p>
<p>I am new to this dog park. I don't have many friends, and my collar is a hand-me-down.</p>
<p>I am young, and know little of the ways of the big dogs.</p>
<p>I'm not a purebred, that's for sure.</p>
<p>I still have a lot of tricks to learn, and I'm not terribly good at the ones I do know.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I am an underdog.</strong></p>
<p>But if you think you can bark me out of here, you are dead wrong.</p>
<p>I may be small, but I will not back down.</p>
<p>Where bigger, complacent dogs might give up, I will keep barking, keep running, and keep learning.</p>
<p>I will make mistakes, and I expect I will get a few nips and bites from others, but I will keep coming back for more until I learn the rules.</p>
<p>Or I will make my own rules, and walk this park with enough moxie to fake it until these old dogs accept my way.</p>
<p>Where others might tuck their tails and play Omega, I'm determined to work my way up to Alpha, and I know that has more to do with <em>presence</em> than size.</p>
<p>I also know it means I'll be trading growls with some dogs I wouldn't beat in a fight.</p>
<p><strong>I'll play anyway.</strong></p>
<p>Not only that, I'll play with my heart and my soul, with every fiber in my scruffy little mutt body.</p>
<p>What I lack in size, muscle, and experience I make up for with determination, sheer tenacity, and a willingness to work harder, bark louder, and own my patch of grass with more certainty than anyone else.</p>
<p>I am wiry and tough, and while a bigger dog might spook at a little bump, I know I can take life's bruises and keep moving.</p>
<p>I am a working dog, not a show dog, and certainly not a pet; that is, I'm not here just to stay in-bounds. I'm here to make a difference.</p>
<p>So, I may be new, but you are sorely mistaken if you think that means I'm not going to change this town.</p>
<p>After all, I have wolf in me, and even if I don't look it, that wild spirit is pure and strong in me.</p>
<p>I have nothing to lose, and I know what losing feels like, and I know I can handle it. I can lose as many times as it takes to win.</p>
<p><strong>I am an underdog, so watch out.</strong></p>
