  out how to use it in daily life.

<p>I recently discovered a secret store of untapped skill and agility that anyone can use. I was out running on a trail with no shoes on, struggling mightily not to stub my toes on all the rocks and stones. It was mentally exhausting. I'd just finished a novel: <em>God Emperor of Dune.</em> One of the main characters in this book has conscious access to all his ancestor's memories and experiences, encoded in his DNA.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that <em>my</em> body also contains the DNA of all of my ancestors, millions of whom probably spent a lot of time running on rugged trails. In fact, encoded into my DNA and all that has arisen out of it are the instincts of tens of millions (maybe more) organisms, not all human, that spent their entire lives navigating wild, treacherous terrain. Along the way, there must have been some creation of an instinct that helped these creatures manage rocky trails.</p>
<p>And, no matter how my life had progressed, <strong>I could not deny that there was in fact some remnant of all that history within me, if only in the way my DNA was constructed</strong>. The experience of my ancestors, all the way back to the first proto-life, had created the blueprint for my existence and the framework around which my brain and nervous system were built. It seemed reasonable to think that perhaps there were some useful instincts prebuilt into me.</p>
<p>So I decided to try something. I stopped consciously thinking about where to put my feet. I let go of the need to control my body and leaned forward to pick up speed, forcing my reflexes to direct my actions in order to avoid injury. I trusted my feet and my body's intelligence.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Like magic, I went flying down the trail, smooth and easy as the wind on the mountainside, absolutely no bumps or bruises.</strong> It felt similar to riding a wave, when you have to give yourself up to a force of nature or wipe out, except that the force of nature, the wave I was riding, welled up from deep within me.</p>
<h3>Applied Ancestry</h3>
<p>The whole premise of natural movement is that, over billions of years, our environments encouraged adaptations within the species that led to us having certain capabilities. <strong>We learned skills as a species</strong>. Just as learning a skill for an individual requires memory and conditioning, so too does it for a species. Our species' memory is our genetic code, and the conditioning comes in the form of physical changes and adaptations. Our two legs and all the software that allows us to move ourselves upon them: that's the species equivalent of a runner's enlarged heart or a lifter's broad shoulders.</p>
<p>(Of course, our ability to develop those individual adaptations to specific stressors in our lives is also part of our ancestral heritage).</p>
<p>So, movements that most closely resemble those already ingrained into our ancestral memory are supported by an ancient knowledge. <strong>Practicing them can help us connect more deeply to our own intuition and instinct</strong>.</p>
<p>Sidestepping all the new age hippie woo woo (not that I normally do in my own life), this has a lot of pragmatic benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>Letting your instinct smartly handle certain situations leaves your conscious mind free to handle higher-level tasks</strong>, like planning strategies, assessing environmental dangers, or having a conversation. A capable and reliable instinct can allow emergency workers to worry less about the minutia of navigating a disaster site and more about executing their rescue plan, for example.</span></li>
<li><strong>Developing sensitivity to your body's intelligence allows you to know what foods and behaviors best support your individual health</strong>. Instead of leaning on one-size-fits-all diets, you can tailor your diet and lifestyle to best support your vitality. This lets you be healthy without feeling deprived.</li>
<li><strong>Intuition about people can help you make better professional and personal decisions</strong>. It is really surprising how much our intuition can gather about a person without the need to actually pry. Learning to trust this instinct--and how far to trust it--can help you determine if someone is trustworthy, if a relationship is worth investing in, or if a person intends you harm.</li>
<li>In order to follow your heart and <strong><a title="How to Find Your Bliss: 3 Questions to Ask Yourself" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-to-find-your-bliss-3-questions-to-ask-yourself/">find your passion</a> or calling</strong>, you must first be able to hear and value your what your heart is telling you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As if often the case, a physical practice (in this case natural movement practiced in an appropriate context) can help us gain insight into ourselves that has applications far beyond the practice itself.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>For me, this realization has had far-reaching consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I no longer feel as </span><a style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" title="How I Turn Fear into Inspiration" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-i-turn-fear-into-inspiration/">disturbed by my own mortality</a></strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">. Having a concrete expression of my heritage led me to conclude that 'me' is just the present-day expression of a much grander idea. I'm just the crest of a wave, at this point in time and space, and when the wave recedes back into the ocean, 'me' will disappear, but I will not (it's a difficult concept to explain, one that deserves it's own full post).</span></li>
<li><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I realized that I have a lot of innate knowledge about the world that I can rely on</strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">. It tends to operate below the level of conscious awareness, but I've been cultivating ways to become more sensitive to it. In the book, </span></span><em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Gift of Fear, </em><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">by Gavin de Becker, the author talks about how our intuition can process information missed by our conscious mind and can give us the results in the form of nagging feelings or sharp and tangible fear. Since intuition is informed by </span></span>experience<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> and instinct, it is another manifestation of this ancestral knowledge I'm talking about. (This will be the topic of another blog post).</span></span></li>
<li><strong>I've started to trust my judgements about people more, while also learning the limits of what I can discern.</strong> I've already used this to avoid getting into certain messy interactions. I was even able to predict exactly what another person did for a living, what his experience in the field was, his relationship status, and his ongoing difficulties with commitment. I 'guessed' every piece of information before he said anything about it, and each point was confirmed by him later in conversation. The really interesting part was that I made my predictions without actually speaking to him directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <a title="3 Unexpected Benefits of Natural Movement" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-unexpected-benefits-of-natural-movement/">besides the health and skill-based benefits</a>, practicing natural movement has opened up a whole new area of capabilities: awareness, instinct, intuition, and reflex. These are all essential in order to maximize our ability to apply our physical skills, a connection that has always been emphasized in the martial arts and in warrior traditions from the Spartans to the Samurai. It was never enough to simply be strong and fast; <a title="The Smiling Swordsman" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-smiling-swordsman/"><strong>discerning insight was always a defining characteristic of a true Warrior</strong></a>.</p>
