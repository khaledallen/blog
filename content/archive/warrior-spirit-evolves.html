    what this blog is about.\r\n\r\nI know, I've said that a lot before, but this
    time it's real.\r\n\r\nCheck it out. See that snazzy new subtitle. This blog isn't
    about me anymore (well, I guess it will always kind of be about me). It's about
    Us, trying to make ourselves the best we can be, so that we can be the most awesome,
    helpful, revolutionary, world-changing people we can."

<p>Okay...I've really got it this time. Seriously. <strong>I now know what this blog is about</strong>.</p>
<p>I know, I've said that a lot before, but this time it's real.</p>
<p>Check it out. See that snazzy new subtitle. This blog isn't about me anymore (well, I guess it will always kind of be about me). It's about <em>Us</em>, trying to make ourselves the best we can be, so that we can be the most awesome, helpful, revolutionary, world-changing people we can.<!--more--></p>
<p>That is the true nature of Warrior Spirit, and I don't know why it took me so long to figure it out.</p>
<p>It is about being the best you can be. Not necessarily perfect, but perfect in your imperfection, at peace with yourself while still pushing yourself to grow and develop.</p>
<p>It is about taking the best care of yourself, <strong>so that you can be there for others</strong>.</p>
<p>It is about <strong>setting out on immense, epic quests</strong>, whether that is to graduate college with integrity and a sense of purpose, or to get yourself and your family out of debt.</p>
<p>It is about facing life's greatest challenges with the <strong>spirit of adventure and a willingness to give it your all</strong>.</p>
<p>It is about never settling for less than you want out of life or yourself.</p>
<p>It is about <strong>personal excellence</strong>, in order to fight for what you believe in with the most effectiveness and energy you can muster.</p>
<p>Also, I'll probably be posting less frequently for a little while as things have gotten overwhelmingly busy around here.</p>
<p><strong>Stick around though. Things are going to get interesting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have additional things to add to the list of "what it is about" above, please post to the comments.</strong></p>
