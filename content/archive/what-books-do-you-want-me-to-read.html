<p>I want to get some suggestions for books you'd all like reviewed. Maybe it's something you've read but want to hear my take on it. Maybe it's something you'd like to read but haven't had time yet, or you want to see if it's good or not. Maybe it's just something you want me to read. Just leave your suggestions in the comment box. Fiction, non-fiction, anything.</p>
