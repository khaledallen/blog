<p>A band of alien misfits sits in a circle, about to enter the biggest battle of their lives, which they expect to be a suicide mission.</p>
<p>And they are at each others' throats.</p>
<p>This is the pep talk scene in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, </em>just before Star Lord, the unofficial leader, steps up and inspires everyone to work together, even to walk into certain death, and support one another.</p>
<p>It seems almost unrealistic--just a convenient outcome to move the plot along--but he uses a technique that is actually a core element of effective leadership.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, it's used by great teachers in classrooms all over the world: connect the task-at-hand with the personal motivations of each individual on the team.</strong></p>
<h3>You can't MAKE other people do anything.</h3>
<p>It's well-known that no matter how much authority and power you have, ultimately, people only do things because they want to. They might want the money you're going to give them, or the recognition, but THEY are the ones deciding to act.</p>
<h3><strong>It can be easy to forget this...unless you're a teacher.</strong></h3>
<p>Teachers know firsthand how vital it is to get a student personally invested in their own academic success. No amount of detentions, low grades, or trips to the principle will convince a student who just isn't invested.</p>
<h3><strong>You have to make them want it for themselves.</strong></h3>
<p>A great teacher knows how to make academic success relevant to every student. If one student doesn't care that much about her own success, but is deeply concerned with living up to her parents' expectations, the teacher might remind her, "What would your mom want for you right now?"</p>
<p>Another student might be powerfully motivated to pursue an athletic career, in which case the teacher might bring in examples of professional athletes whose game benefited from studying hard.</p>
<p>A leader in other contexts has to do the same thing: find out what your team members care about and help them connect it to the group's mission.<!--more--></p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-237" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/woman-hand-girl-glass-e1436306723958.jpg" alt="leadership has a lot in common with teaching" width="700" height="467" /></h3>
<h3>Then, they'll do anything.</h3>
<p>A friend of mine who is a great teacher told me that the most important thing a teacher has to do is show the students that she cares about them. Once the students believe this (and faking it won't work), they will understand that whatever you're asking them to do is in their best interests.</p>
<p>But you cannot tell your students or your teammates how to go about accomplishing the goals central to the team's mission.</p>
<p>Really, you don't actually want to. Teams and classrooms shine when their individual members bring unique perspectives and approaches to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>And the only way they will do that is if they are inspired and feel like their contributions are valued.</p>
<p>If they don't know how to do what you need from them, they will figure it out far better than you just showing them. As long as they care, they will find a way. (<em>As a tutor, I've found that I don't always have to know the material better than my student. I just have to inspire them to care enough so they can figure it out</em>).</p>
<blockquote><p>The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. - William Arthur Warm</p></blockquote>
<h3>This is teaching and leading: getting someone to acquire skills.</h3>
<p><strong>Ultimately, great leadership is all about creating an environment where the team can learn and improve itself.</strong></p>
<p>The learning might be internal--teammates learning how to work together--or it might be external--learning to respond to market conditions--or a combination.</p>
<p>But you know good leadership when you see it because the team being led is able to adapt to challenges and get its job done.</p>
<p>Essentially, it is able to learn quickly thanks to the leader(s) ability to support learning.</p>
<h3>Here's how they do it.</h3>
<p>Leaders can support learning in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting a team from external pressures (especially true in large corporations where the team is a small development team)</li>
<li>Creating an environment where mistakes are not punished, but seen as learning opportunities</li>
<li>Actually connecting teammates with the resources they need to do their work or improve</li>
<li>Understanding what motivates individual teammates and making sure they see a connection between that and their work</li>
<li>Handling motivation, inspiration, and team dynamics while the authority handles process and delegation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Try it yourself.</h3>
<p><em><strong>Find out why your teammates/classmates show up every day. Then think about ways you can</strong> <strong>help them connect their passion with the group's work.</strong></em></p>
