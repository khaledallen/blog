<p>I recently saw a really humorous series of short videos about how to be suave while living at your parents’ house after college. A young man in a bathrobe introduced himself as so many of us graduates do: a list of impressive academic accomplishments, compelling personality traits, a powerful drive for success, and, oh yeah, unemployed and living at home. The narrator then goes on to explain how to ‘be suave’ while living around your parents. For example, dealing with the fact that your mom still does your laundry, or capitalizing on recurring fashion cycles to make use of your dad’s wardrobe.<!--more--></p>
<p>It is obviously a reach.</p>
<p>While I am not technically unemployed, I am still living at home, as are a number of my friends. And while I did find this video really funny, it struck home for me. I am a capable, ambitious young guy, so why am I still at home when I know a lot of my friends are living independently.</p>
<p><strong>Fear of the Unknown</strong></p>
<p>This is probably my biggest excuse. I admit that I’m scared of handling all my own stuff. And without my parents around, there isn’t that nice safety net.</p>
<p>Realistically though, I’ve pretty much managed to maintain my own finances without going broke. I do get free lodging and transportation though, which is a lot.</p>
<p><strong>It Takes Time to Set Up</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to work a regular corporate job. So I’m taking the time to establish myself as a freelancer and an entrepreneur. I know the American dream is to get a regular job and toil away in your spare hours to earn your freedom, but I don’t really have to do that, so why should I?</p>
<p>While this may seem like me being an overprivileged, white, middle-class snot, I can’t really justify hog-tying myself just to put myself on an equal playing field for the sake of appearances. By consolidating my resources, I can lay a really solid foundation and when it comes time to start my own business, I should be able to do so with a decent chance of success.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong. Perhaps not working a regular job is robbing me of the experiences I need to run a business. We’ll see soon enough I guess.</p>
<p><strong>No Guidebook</strong></p>
<p>Because I didn’t follow the traditional model of go to school-graduate-get a regular job, I don’t really have a laid out path to follow. A big part of my inertia is the result of simply not knowing how to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Laziness</strong></p>
<p>And a big part of my inertia is the fact that I don’t have to proceed at this point.</p>
<p>Until I got that kick in the pants. Now I feel pretty lame living at my parents house (don’t get me wrong, they are wonderful people, I will be paying rent in a month, and I contribute resources and effort when I can). It is long past time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>So What Has Changed?</strong></p>
<p>Thinking about my priorities, moving out wasn’t really at the top of the list. I realized, however, that it would be much easier to accomplish the others if I did move out, because living on my own would also mean I had the resources to pursue other projects as well.</p>
<p>So I started thinking objectively. What do I need to do to get out?</p>
<p>Make more money was the biggest thing. I can’t afford an apartment in the area I live right now, but I am pretty close.</p>
<p>The best way I can think of to make money without sacrificing my soul is to pursue an independent business that I am interested in and which I can run on my own terms. So I need to take some initiative. I’ve been talking about starting my own small business for a long time, and nothing ever gets done. I aim to change that, starting now.</p>
<p>The biggest holes in my plan, as I pointed out above, were lack of knowledge, and fear. I think I’ve gotten to the point where frustration overcomes fear, and I have decided that the best way to remedy a lack of knowledge is to just start trying things and learn as I go. Clearly, I’m not learning what I need to by reading empowerment blogs…</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to put that out there. I’m still working on a lot of pretty basic things. I am a little ashamed that I’m still living with my parents, even though I’ve done really well in terms of gainful employment. Hopefully, I can turn that into positive motivation to start the ball rolling.</p>
<p><strong>Fight on, Brave Warrior!</strong></p>
