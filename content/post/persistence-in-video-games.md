One of my favorite things about well-designed video games is that I always know what I need to do to get better at them. They provide clear and consistent feedback, and you can generally test out different approaches really quickly. Good games also pace your progress, or give a clear indication that you just need to keep trying.

For example, a friend and I are playing through Halo 2's Legendary Co-op campaign. It has been one of the most difficult and frustrating experiences I've ever had, and not just in gaming. The power discrepancy between our characters and the enemy is humorously vast. If one of us dies, we have to restart from the last checkpoint, and the checkpoints are
not well distributed.

However, the game goes provide really good feedback–enemies consistently take full advantage of even the tiniest mistakes–and a very fast feedback cycle: when one of us dies, it only takes a few seconds to restart. So we learn very quickly what works and what doesn't. It is also clear we aren't missing anything: our characters start with all the gear and strength they will ever have throughout the game, so the game makes it very obvious that any progression in your character's abilities will come from the player's skills. Thus, we don't waste time looking for power-ups.

Progress is simply controlled by a linear map. You can't move into the next room until you clear the current one. If a door is unlocked, it suggests that you just need to get to the door without clearing the room.

This does not make the game easy. We die a lot. It took us 3 hours last night to get through a single room. The game is also widely known to be broken on this difficulty setting. But we are willing to persist because we get feedback on each attempt and we know we have everything we need to move forward, if only we can execute perfectly and maybe get lucky.

In constrast, Hollow Knight has a different setup. It is also
punishingly difficult, but your pause screen clearly indicates empty spaces for powers and upgrades you have yet to find. The most difficult areas and bosses are closed to you until you have the abilities you need to beat them. In some cases, you're welcome to try a harder section or boss before you have all the power-ups, but there are no penalties for failing in these cases (not even losing a life). Bosses all have a pattern, and if you can learn it, you can overcome them. Similar to chess, if you lose, you can see exactly where you messed up. But you can keep trying and save points are generally pretty close to bosses, especially the harder ones.

Progress in these games on the harder settings are entirely based on your willingness to keep trying. If you don't want to die a lot, don't play. But if you're willing to try, you can improve and succeed.

## Now, compare this to traditional education. 

The feedback loops are slow: in high school, it can take several days or longer to get feedback on homework, and tests are generally pretty infrequent. In college, the delay can be even longer, and you generally don't get tests more than 3 times a semester, if not a single final at the end.

The consequences for failure are steep and permanent. Poor grades rob you of opportunities in the future, label you as inadequate, and the knowledge gaps you accrue make it harder to progress. Despite that, you are often allowed to progress, telling you that the gaps are not important or don't even exist.

Trying a lot will still generally guarantee success, but trying is costly. If you fail high school, there's stigma to overcome. College is expensive and very, very time-consuming. A second, or third, run is not trivial. You have deal with bureaucracy, submit applications (which themselves often bar you based on your previous failures), and spend lots of money.

Imagine if a game worked that way. Dying in the game would  make it  more and more difficult as you progressed, until it literally kicked you out. It would have explicit indications that you were a poor player, maybe even telling you to stop playing. It would let you progress far into the hardest levels with no indication that you were supposed to have completed some previous elements, then smack you with the hardest boss, which would be presented as if you were ready for it but which would kill you instantly. Most enemies would just be bosses and they would be relatively infrequent. There would be no indication that you had gaps in your powers or items. The message the game would send is that it didn't really want you to win. If you weren't already good at it, you shouldn't be playing it. It was trying to get you to stop playing, punishing you for trying.

It would be horrible. Nobody would play such a game. 

Obviously, this is a bit of a worst-case example. There are schools that provide lots of support and encouragement, with well-structure pedagogy. But even those implement systems that allow students to move forward despite having failed to master previous material. The grading system itself is a problem.

I don't have a problem with grades per se. But there should be a distinction between grades as cost-free feedback and grades as assessment. It is important to know where you stand as a learner, and tests, quizzes, and projects are the best way to get that information. But why make it so costly to fail? To disincentivize it? The threat of failure is not a great motivator compared to the promise of success. Especially when you are playing a new game.

Consider Khan Academy. Feedback is instant: you know immediately when you get a problem right or wrong, and you are tested constantly, because every learning module is basically a mini-quiz. There are clear indications of gaps that need to be filled. Help is literally a click away, as every mini-quiz has a link to the corresponding teaching video. Khan Academy eliminates the process of "figuring out the game," so you can focus on the actual material being presented.

Unless they enjoyed the process of figuring out the game itself.

## Adjusting course

This wasn't the first time we'd used this strategy. The previous three times we had gotten really far, but run out of ammo. We realized it was a mistake to use our best guns at the start, because they enemies were crowded enough that we could afford less accurate weapons. That mistake cost us in the end, so we adjusted and incorporated it into our best-so-far approach.

When I was a little kid, I used to get frustrated at video games if they were hard. I got upset that the game seemed unfair, and I didn't think to adjust my approach to beat them. In reality, I was actually getting better, which meant adjusting my approach, but I was too young to realize it.

Now, I make the adjustments consicously. Every time we die in Halo, we learn something, and we adjust. This is true in the other unforgiving games I like to play, such as Hollow Knight.

Many students who succeed at school spend a lot of time figuring out the game being played by the educational system. What makes a good school versus a poor one, in my opinion, has a lot to do with how it presents the game being played. A good school provides lots of good feedback, helps students fill in gaps, is clear about what is required, and is consistent. I went to a great school which implemented excellent pedagogy (i.e., the school game). Teachers graded and returned homework quickly and they had office hours. They told you when you needed to come in to office hours to get extra help, and prereqs were clear and explicit.

But if a school isn't going to provide that information, the students have to figure it out. And that's where I think colleges and universities often fail. Kids show up to university having succeeded (or not) in high school, which may have better or worse pedagogy. They are told that university will be harder, but often not exactly how it will be harder. College is much more like real life, in that you aren't provided with rules and feedback is opaque and inconsistent. Students just think the material is harder and the professors are more demanding. But the reality is, I think, very different.

To succeed in college, students need to impose a structure on their own learning. My second run through college was much, much more fruitful than my first because I knew this going in (though not to the level I do now). I had to increase the rate of my feedback cycle. I had to start my homework early, question my approach to it, go to office hours to check if I was "on the right track," and interact with professors frequently. Grades were a very poor feedback mechanism because they were relatively infrequent and if they indicated a problem, we were already past the material they had been testing, and there was no time to go back and make up for lost time. There were at most 3 tests per semester. And while it makes sense not to give away too much help, I had professors who seemed to think being cagey and mysterious was the best way to answer questions.

I know I'm not just whining about a difficult educational track because I had three professors that were amazing, and in whose classes I learned and have retained a ton of useful information. Two of them moved slowly and provided weekly quizzes. The third provided 4 or 5 exams (which she called quizzes), and was actually helpful in office hours. Each professor taught a course at a different level: 2000, 3000, and 4000. They recognized that structured learning with lots of quick feedback was the best way to learn something.

I do think that imposing a structure on material is an important skill for any learner to master, especially a lifelong self-learner. In general, most experiences in life are not well-structured for learning. But college actively undermines your ability to learn.

And honestly, I think most professors know this. In my hardest classes (the ones with the worst feedback loops, professors who explicitly told students they were failures, classes that skipped large chunks of the curriculum because it was "too basic to waste time on," ignored or lacked a syllabus, and moved at a pace that suggested the entire curriculum was mere review), the grades did not reflect the performance of the students.

What I mean is that most students got grades much higher than their scores would justify. I got an A in a class where I scored 81%, 59%, and `UNDEFINED`% on my first, second, and final exams respectively. Unless I aced that final (highly unlikely, and even then), my guess is that the professor realized he simply couldn't fail the entire class.



thats Halo teaches me that a good strategy is usually also a forgiving strategy. If our strategy relies on shooting perfectly every time or overwhelming an enemy, it's probably not going to work. It needs to account for the fact that we are much weaker than our enemies and run out of ammo. The strategies that work are almost always the ones that allow us to be imperfect.

That said, we've also gotten lucky occasionally and had a run of perfect headshots and sneak attacks.
