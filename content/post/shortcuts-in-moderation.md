title: Shortcuts In Moderation

When I started learning to bake bread, I used active dry yeast. It was
easy and with the right recipe, I could get reasonably good results
without all the complications of a sourdough starter. But I always aspired
to make bread with the starter, and for a while, I believed that using
a starter was the only real way to make bread. I also thought that once
I moved to using a starter, I would never make bread the "easy way" again.

Eventually, I did learn how to make sourdough bread. But some recipes work
better when I use active dry yeast, and sometimes I want to make a loaf
without needing to plan a day ahead (like this morning). Sometimes, the
recipe I'm making needs a bit of extra lift, so I use both (like many of
the excellent recipes in _Tartine Bread_, which I think started the
current artisanal baking trend).

Is it cheating to use active dry yeast? Is it inauthentic?

From 2010 to 2016, my answer would have been yes. I would have said the
modern obsession with convenience poisoned our food and destroyed our
health, so of course modern shortcuts are just expressions of our diseased
society (I was lots of fun back then).

Now, I don't think there's anyone keeping score. If the bread comes out
well and the timing of the recipe suits my life, then it's a win. I made
a good loaf that I can enjoy and share with my neighbors. I feel
like the joy of simple pleasure outweighs any negative health effects of
using modern methods, and the anxiety of worrying about every little
health impact would undo the benefits (I've been down that road).

A common refrain in the historical costume YouTube community is that these
folks love the fashion of times gone by, but that doesn't mean they don't
prefer the modern world with its (better) social equality, indoor
plumbing, and climate control. Some of them insist on using authentic,
historical sewing techniques (always, or when it suits them), and some of
them use modern tools and methods while still constructing historical
silohouttes and styles. They do what suits their lifestyles and actually
gets the dresses made.

I like that we can get the best of both worlds: old country loaves in
a day, or lovely Regency fashion without oppression of women. Shortcuts in
moderation aren't always a bad thing, as long as we are mindful of the
effects they have on the final product, which don't have to be negative.
If something has been done a particular way for a long time, and it's
a pain, I would like to first understand why, and then find a better way
that doesn't break stuff.
