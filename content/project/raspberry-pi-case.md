This is a case for my Raspberry Pi, which I use to stream games from my CLX gaming PC to various locations in the house using Parsec. You can see more about that project [here](#) (link coming soon).

There have been several iterations of this case. The first iteration, I had trouble with the sizing and spacing of the USB ports in the RPi model I used in Fusion360. As a result, the actual Pi did not fit in the case when printed. I also didn't realize that I needed to slice the case in half as there isn't enough space for the ports to slide in otherwise. This resulted in several broken attempts.

Once I figured out the spacing and the insertion method, I needed to sort out a way to secure the top to the bottom. The simplest solution I came up with was just to design some screw posts into the outside of the case, but the Pi 3B+ has various ports in locations that make it impossible to get a nice symmetric arrangement for this solution. Internal clips were definitely the ideal, but those were beyond my Fusion360 skills.

Once I had a basically working design, I started over with a much better build process in Fusion360, keeping my components and bodies cleanly organized. I got a working version with external screw posts, and then dove into figuring out a way to do internal clips, which is the latest prototype (printing as I write this).

Once the PLA prototype is checked, I will print in semi-transparent PETG, which will be more heat resistent, allow me to see the LEDs on the Pi, and which is a stronger material for lasting durability.
