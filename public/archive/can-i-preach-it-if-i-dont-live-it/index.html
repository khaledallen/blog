<p>As you may know from reading <a title="My Personal Epic" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/my-personal-epic/">my personal story</a>,  I was actually a pretty unhappy kid back in high school and college. I  became an expert on motivating myself in order to survive. By studying  Buddhism and positive psychology and applying them to my own life, I was  able to develop myself into a reasonably confident, self-sufficient  dude. Now, I share what I’ve learned in order to help you chase after  the <a title="Follow Your Own Path" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/follow-your-own-path/">great dreams</a> in your lives which require a lot of self-motivation  and ambition.</p>
<p>Because I write about this stuff, you’d think that I’m  always up and rearing to go, but the truth is I have plenty of down  days. <strong>I think that is what makes me believable and enables me to  maintain perspective.</strong> If I never had to apply my own techniques, they’d  become pretty rusty and I wouldn’t be able to write about them very  well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, is it really fair for me to be telling  you to go out and change the world when I can’t even work up the energy  to change out of my PJs?</p>
<p><strong>I actually don’t think that it it okay for me to do that.</strong> This blog is one method I use for motivating myself. I’ve committed to  writing about the Warrior Spirit, and part of my sense of <a title="The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-meaning-of-integrity-the-complete-human/">integrity</a> requires that I therefore <em>live</em> the Warrior Spirit. So whether you  like it or not, you give me the encouragement to fight for what I  believe in day after day. You are my inspiration (in a non-mushy way).</p>
<p>Self-motivation and personal quirks aside, I think that my  advice can still be useful to you even if I don’t manage to live it  every single day. In a way, it’s like my gymnastics coach. It had been a  long time since he’d last practiced what he taught me, but he had the  experience and the eye for coaching that let him convey the ideas  effectively without having to be able to perform the skills.</p>
<p>Of course, he was once a very accomplished gymnast, so I think experience of what you’re teaching is important at some point. <strong>You have to have walked the same path at least once before in order to guide someone else along it.</strong></p>
<p>I guess ultimately it comes down to you, my reader. <strong>If you find what I write to be useful, then read and share with your friends.</strong> If you think it’s all invalid because sometimes I don’t live up to my own call-to-arms, then that’s your choice.</p>
<p>Part of the Warrior Spirit is dealing with your own  shortcomings. The true Warrior can fail, brush him or herself off, and  get up to try again. <strong>It would be too easy to be perfect all the time.</strong> It is far more difficult to accept that you’re not perfect but to believe that you have worthwhile things to say despite that, and to say those things with conviction.</p>
<p>Anyway, now you know I’m not perfect (in case there was any doubt in your mind).</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for reading! If you found this post inspiring, please share it with some friends, or on Twitter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fight on, Brave Warriors!</strong></p>
