<p>Hoyt later replays the night in his mind, trying to figure out why he caught the bodyguard off-guard. He comes to the conclusion that people of his caliber, those alpha males at the top of the social ladder, don't consent to being pushed around. They are so supremely confident in the rightness of their actions, their right to be wherever they want, that they simply impose that frame on other people.</p>
<p>I find this concept interesting because Hoyt generally comes off as a 'cad' to use the words of another character in the book. Despite this, however, he is undoubtedly dominant among men and attractive to women for his refusal to submit to another person's implied frame. In the above example, he refused to submit to the implication in the bodyguard's question that he was doing something wrong.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how to view this character. One of the female characters in the book is both offended by and attracted to him. Other men generally view him with awe or as a fool. A particularly intelligent guy, Adam, looks at the socially superior with resentment, constantly hinting that ten years from now, he'll be the one with the good job while they suffer for their lack of dedication to their studies. But his threats are hollow. The reader knows that he will be the one still struggling to get what he wants, despite his vast intelligence, while the Hoyts of the world will dazzle with their sheer force of character and get what they want, learning the necessary skills later (or not at all).</p>
<p>Obviously, there are ties to the book <em>No More Mr. Nice Guy,</em> but I think this dichotomy speaks to a larger split in our educational system. There is an emphasis on the academic, while success in the real world is often more closely associated with the social. Those same individuals who are despised by teachers for their lack of dedication to their studies are often the most popular among their peers, and the most impressive to adults in non-teaching roles.</p>
<p>I think this trait, which is often seen as simple arrogance, is actually a useful tool to utilize under certain circumstances. It seems that using it all the time would just be obnoxious. It would even be indicative of a need to control every situation, an insecurity born of a fear of loss of control. Nevertheless, how liberating would it be to always be convinced of your own validity? With that certainty would come the feeling that you could do whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted.</p>
<p>It is truly surprising how often we accept other people's implicit frames. When someone asks me if you're having fun at a party, there could be the implication that they are your social superior, graciously checking on your well-being. How you respond, whether you respond at all, also has implications for subtle, subconscious calculations of social worth. None of this is conscious, and in fact becomes counterproductive if it becomes conscious, but it is certainly real. All these little interactions, earning or losing you points, all add up to that impression you form of a person, whether they are shy, outgoing, reliable, a pushover, dominant, assertive, etc.</p>
<p>A good example in my life was a recent high school networking event I attended. In high school, I was extremely shy and passive, but at the event, I was dressed in a way the old me would never have dressed – assertive, confident – and my posture, my whole bearing was completely different. A lot of my old friends didn't recognize me, pointing to the clothes and the demeanor as reasons, but were pleased to see the change. Afterwards, I rallied a large group of friends and led the way to a restaurant for a sort of spur-of-the-moment reunion dinner. Again, my taking charge like that was incongruous with the images many of my friends had of me in high school, but instead of defaulting to the old dynamic where I would have just tagged along, my behavior, which was assertive, confident, and simply assumed I was taking the lead, led people to accept me as the organizer of the outing. I got several comments on the change, indicating that the 'points' mentioned above were real. In this case, their existence was more noticeable because they hadn't existed before.</p>
<p>So why are some people used to having their frame accepted more often? Why do nerds so often consent to letting others define the terms of their reality? How strong is your frame? Have I even done a good job of conveying what a 'frame' is or am I just babbling to myself?</p>
