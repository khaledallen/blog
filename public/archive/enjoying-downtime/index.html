</p>
<p>Even when I don’t have to be anywhere or if I don’t have  work on a given day, I feel guilty staying in bed late or doing anything  that doesn’t seem to produce something tangible. It has taken some  convincing to get myself to just let go of my time.</p>
<h3>Money is not a Good Standard</h3>
<p>I quickly realized that <a title="Cash or Friends? Where are Your Priorities?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/cash-or-friends-where-are-your-priorities/">whether an activity</a> made money  wasn’t a good criteria for value either. I spent about a week writing  fitness articles for a content-creation site, and if I wrote for a mere 2  hours a day, I could make quite a bit of money. But I felt like I was  wasting my own time, as well as that of my readers (the website was  focused on targeting keywords for ad revenue rather than actually  producing educational content). Obviously, an activity had to be  productive by my standards for it to feel like a good use of my time.  But I was still clinging to the idea of making good use of my time.</p>
<h3>Spending Time with Friends Shouldn't be Productive</h3>
<p>This is especially problematic when I’m spending time with  my friends or family. Time to connect is extremely important for one’s  personal health and relationships, but it isn’t ‘productive’ in the  traditional sense of the word. The result was that I always felt like I  needed to be somewhere else, and I could never give my full attention to  the people I was with.</p>
<p>People suggested I treat socializing like any other  important activity, but I found that made me treat it like a workout;  you show up, you perform the prescribed activities, and you go on with  your day. It became just another task on my to-do list of  self-improvement. I didn’t want to treat my friendships that way.</p>
<p>So I finally decided that if time spent with friends feels  unproductive, then I need to learn that being productive is not always  something to be chased after.</p>
<h3>Being Unproductive Makes it Easier to be Productive</h3>
<p>After that, I came to realize that my favorite times of  the day were those when I wasn’t being productive. Going for a jog in  the woods, with no intention of ‘working out’ helped me center myself.  Going to play at the gymnastics gym, without a plan or a specific goal  in mind, other than to enjoy myself, helped me enjoy exercise.</p>
<p>Once I started letting myself be unproductive, I was able  to actually be much more productive during the times I set aside for  work. I recently picked up a job requiring me to reformat an entire  book, from PDF to an eBook. This is extremely tedious work (though of a  type I find oddly engaging), and is the kind of thing that would allow  of easy self-distraction. But, because I have recently gotten into the  habit of letting my mind relax, I found it really easy to concentrate  when the task called for it. Suddenly, I find myself able to work for  hours on end without a hint of boredom or distractibility.</p>
<p>I actually didn’t even notice this new ability until I sat  down to write this post. Looking back over my week, I played a lot of  Starcraft II, spent a lot of time reading and just relaxing, got to play  at gymnastics and in the woods, and have just generally taken things  slowly. During the same time, I’ve also been almost as productive as I  was at college (except for being at a complete loss for blog posts…sorry  about that). When I do decide to do work, I get it done quickly and  efficiently.</p>
<p>Remembering how to play seems to have helped me get better at doing work.</p>
<p>So I’m trying to come up with a more useful standard of  whether an activity is worth my time, a standard based on happiness  rather than production. If it makes me or someone else happy, then it is  worth doing. Otherwise, I need to reconsider how I spend my time.</p>
