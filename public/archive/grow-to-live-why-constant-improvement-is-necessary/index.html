<p>I have recently attained a lot of the fitness goals I set for myself when I started taking my training seriously. I wanted to be able to snatch my bodyweight, deadlift more than twice my bodyweight, do a standing backflip and some other basic tumbling moves, run a fast quarter mile, run a marathon, be able to do CrossFit WODs at the Rx’d weights, and do a few handstand pushups. I’m still working on the one arm pushup and a few other things, but I’m pretty satisfied with where I am now.</p>
<p>Now that I can do these things, I found that my motivation to keep training waned a bit. Getting to this point cost me a lot. I suffered a lot of injuries, stressed out about schedules, consistency and performance, and missed out on a lot of social opportunities because I was either too tired or couldn’t eat the food/drink. It was not easy.</p>
<p>And the question that kept floating around in my head was: is it all worth it? Should I keep this up?</p>
<h3><strong>Why Improve</strong></h3>
<p>At first, I didn’t really think it was worth it. I could maintain my current level of fitness without too much additional effort. Continued improvement would come at a high price, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to pay that price. Why keep trying to improve if I’m happy with where I am now?</p>
<p>The only answer that came to mind was simply because I can. If there’s room for improvement, I should fill it. For a few weeks, that wasn’t really good enough. I was tired and I needed something more concrete.</p>
<p>That nagging insistence that I keep improving wouldn’t go away. Maintaining felt like giving up, even though I could do everything I wanted or needed to. Was I supposed to try to keep getting better forever? Would I never be able to just enjoy myself and accept myself as I am?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question turned out to be, yes; I am supposed to try to keep getting better forever. The answer to the second question is no; I must learn to accept myself as I am, even as I push to grow and improve.</p>
<p>I felt like a waste of space if I wasn’t growing. Staying the same wasn’t good enough. <strong>I felt that I had an obligation to be the best I could be. </strong>To honor my good fortune in being born, I had the responsibility to make the most of my self and my life.</p>
<p>This attitude — honoring the fortune of my existence — is inspired by a Buddhist outlook on being grateful for what you have. If what I have is potential, the best way to be grateful for it is to develop it.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee’s outlook is interesting because it suggests that failure to grow is worse than death; it is better to risk being killed in an attempt to grow and improve. Stagnating may not be literal death, but it is death of the spirit, and ultimately leads to a long, slow process of decay that simply starts the process of decomposition before you’re put in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Life is growth. Death is stagnation.</strong></p>
