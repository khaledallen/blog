<p>Good games are good because they support learning in a way that empowers the player. They make it hard (but possible) to do what you want, and let you struggle, giving just enough to reward you for your effort.</p>
<p><strong>But maybe you're saying, "These are just games. They don't translate to the real-world." Actually, they do it you approach them the right way.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Take <em>Halo 2,</em> a classic multiplayer first-person shooter. In order to succeed in online play, you had to predict what other players would do. One common tactic was to wait until just after you'd made a kill to attack. You would be in the middle of reloading and low on shields, so you were very vulnerable.</p>
<p>To deal with this, I developed the habit of scanning over both shoulders right after a fight, moving in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Then, when I started studying for my upper belts in Kenpo, my instructor introduced the idea that after a fight, I'd be vulnerable and an easy target. As soon as I realized that, I automatically started using the same scanning technique, which is actually taught in Kenpo, but I didn't have to learn it all over again. I just translated it from <em>Halo 2</em> to self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>I had learned the habit, in a nearly identical context and with identical results for failure and success, from playing the game.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I didn't set out to learn that from playing the game; I was motivated to play for other reasons. It just happened to be the kind of behavior that the game rewarded.</p>
<p>So, if you are trying to learn a skill, think about the kinds of games that can help you master it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Athletics, dance, or martial arts have rewarding goals that are easier to achieve with good fitness, so you get fit automatically to play well (if you're invested).</li>
<li>Music itself offers similar rewards to gameplay: you can play any notes you want, but only the right ones will sound good.</li>
<li>Various board games teach a variety of skills, from basics of capital (Monopoly) to communicating via pictures (Pictionary). Chess is well-known for its many benefits, from visual tracking to imagining the future to maintaining composure under stress.</li>
<li>Card games, especially poker, are known to teach people-reading and self-control as well as risk-assessment and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key is to actually seek to learn from the game, not just to win it, and to commit to getting good. If you approach a game as pure distraction, it loses its value.</strong></p>
<p><em>For a brilliant example of stealth learning in a game, <a href="http://www.machineers.com/" target="_blank">check out Machineers</a>. This game is designed to teach procedural logic (programming-think for the rest of us) without being blatantly educational. It's won several awards; it's also simply fun.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What skill could help you perform better? Brainstorm some games that might help you master it and share them in the comments.<br />
