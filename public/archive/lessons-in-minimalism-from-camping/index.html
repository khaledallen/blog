<p>The thing about camping that appeals to me now is the very thing that I most despised about it when I was younger. The fact that you have to make due with the least possible amount of <a title="Branding Our Lives" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/branding-our-lives/">stuff</a> made me uncomfortable and anxious. I was always afraid I'd miss out on something, or be left without something necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, it was the process of eliminating the non-essential that made camping so liberating. After the first few days of missing my video games, I found that I was alright. It turned out that there was a lot for me to do <a title="The Wilderness in Your Backyard" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-wilderness-in-your-backyard/">in the woods</a>: fishing, exploring the lakeshore, swimming, just sitting and appreciating nature, reading. My days were full of all sorts of activities, and I enjoyed the free time, the ability to set my own schedule and follow my natural rhythms rather than a school clock.</p>
<p>You learn a lot about what it takes to be happy when you're in the woods. Food, shelter, warmth, and a destination. That's really all you need.</p>
<p>During one of my trips when I was leading a group of boys in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, we pulled into a campsite just as a rainstorm descended on us. We quickly made camp, secured our gear, and hastily prepared a hot dinner. As I was on a different diet, I didn't get a chance to eat, so once the boys were in their tent, I pulled out a camp stove, cleared a tiny space among our gear pile, and crouched to make myself some soup.</p>
<p>I ate it lying on a pile of bags, a flimsy tarp inches above me keeping the rain at bay, my bare feet sticking out in the mud. I was in heaven. I was (mostly) dry, had something warm to fill my belly, and could relax. It is one of the happiest moments of my life.</p>
<p><strong>We tend to overestimate the stuff we need to be happy.</strong> I didn't even need a tent at that moment to be content.</p>
<p>So it might pay to ask yourself how much of your stuff you really need. On a camping trip, too much stuff can actually be worse than too little. You might be able to get by without a few items, but carrying extra weight over many miles of rough terrain will destroy your spirit very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Just like in the rest of life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So travel light, and learn to appreciate having the essentials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fight on, Brave Warriors!</strong></p>
