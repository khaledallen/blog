<p>I like to live my life with the intent of doing odd and noteworthy things. I figure that the whole point of the Warrior Spirit is taking on adventures that most people rarely experience.<strong> </strong>I just don't want my life to be another iteration of the same boring story that's already been told millions of times. <strong>I want my life to stand out. I want my life to serve as inspiration to others, to be so amazing and unique as to incite skepticism.</strong> I want my grandkids to hear of my adventures and doubt the veracity of their parents tall tales.</p>
<h3>Commit to Adventure</h3>
<p>Your chosen activity doesn't have to be something as extreme as gymnastics either.</p>
<p>You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take on the task of committing to writing a novel.</li>
<li>Go skydiving.</li>
<li>Get your pilot's license.</li>
<li>Buy a motorcycle.</li>
<li>Learn how to cook fancy French cuisine.</li>
<li>Start a garden and grow all your tomatoes.</li>
<li>Read "War and Peace".</li>
<li>Renovate a room in your house on your own.</li>
<li>Build a greenhouse.</li>
<li>Build a chair.</li>
<li>Start a podcast series about your love of dogs or knitting.</li>
<li>Find love</li>
<li>Uncover the story of your family's past</li>
</ul>
<p>These things aren't necessarily all dangerous, and many of them aren't that unique, but most people don't do them. How many people do you know who actually grow a lot of their own food? How many pilots do you know? How many people do you know that are familiar with their entire family tree and could tell you an interesting story about every branch? How adventuresome would it be for you to become that person among your friends?</p>
<p>If you have dreams that ignite your passion, chances are they will lead you on some pretty wild adventures if you follow them through to their completion. For most people, the difference between an adventure and a false start hobby is actually following through and doing it.</p>
<h3>Leading the Way</h3>
<p>Deciding to lead an adventuresome life is not only good for your own sense of purpose and fulfillment; <strong>it also inspires others who might have similar ambitions</strong>. Warriors ought to lead the way for their communities, and what better way to do that than to forge a new path in the pursuit of adventure?</p>
<p>When I started CrossFit, I was working at a summer camp. In order to get in my workout, I had to wake up before the camp day started and improvise all my workouts with trees, logs, rocks, and random heavy objects (aluminum canoes, eg). My counselor friends thought I was crazy. I kept at it, despite the inconvenience and isolation, and at the end of the summer, several of them told me personally how much I had inspired them, simply by doing something different in line with my own goals and ambitions. Many started taking fitness more seriously themselves as a result of my dedication.</p>
<p>This story just goes to show that you can help others out a lot by going after your own goals.</p>
<h3>Everyday Adventures</h3>
<p>These kinds of adventures can be had any time, as long as you are living ambitiously and taking some chances. Having an experienced contractor renovate your home isn't as much of an adventure as learning how to do it yourself. Yes, you should probably learn some of the basic skills first, but you'll be learning by trial and error, making mistakes, and really getting your hands dirty. And when you're done, you will have something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Travel is probably the most common adventure most people undertake. They are going to a new land, learning new cultures, and are forced to find their way with their own resources. If you've ever done any traveling, you know how frustrating it can be and how easy it is to run into huge obstacles. But you also know how rewarding it is to overcome these obstacles. We don't enjoy travel because it is easy. We enjoy it because the experiences we gain are worth the challenges.</p>
<p><strong>So really, an adventuresome life is one filled with new experiences.</strong> It tends to be characterized by do-it-yourselfism, plenty of mistakes, and a great deal of frustration. If you don't want to make any mistakes, can't deal with frustration, and prefer to pay others to do things instead of learning them yourself, you probably won't enjoy having many adventures.</p>
<p>Since most people fall into that category, it leaves plenty of adventuring for the rest of us.</p>
