<h1>Stop Making the Same Mistakes With This Simple Question</h1>

</p>
<p>The first two or three times, you might not worry, but the tenth or twentieth time has you questioning your intelligence, your value as a human being, throwing the game controller at the screen (my signature tantrum as a kid).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mistakes.jpg" alt="mistakes" width="700" height="394" /></p>
<p><strong>You find yourself thinking that you should just give up.</strong> Clearly you're not cut out for this skill/relationship/job (or video game...Why was Mega Man so hard?). If you can't learn from your mistakes, then this just isn't for you.</p>
<p>Working with kids preparing for the ACT, I saw students all the time who were disheartened because they had taken the test numerous times without seeing any improvement in their score.</p>
<p>This just doesn't make sense. After all, if you do something enough, you should get better at it, and these kids often had taken the test half a dozen times before they saw me.</p>
<p>Usually, within aÂ  single session, I can help them break the cycle by asking them a simple question when they mess up:</p>
<h3><strong>What specific action can you take the next time this situation (question type) comes up that will let you avoid making the same mistake?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Most people focus on their own effort to improve.</strong> When they make a mistake, they tell themselves, "I'll try harder next time," or, "I'll be more careful."</p>
<p>But what exactly does it mean to "try harder?" What does it mean to "be more careful?" Does that mean wearing a helmet, or going more slowly, or paying better attention by not having your phone out during a serious conversation with your significant other?</p>
<p>Most of the kids I worked with simply told themselves, "I will be more careful next time."</p>
<p>When I ask them, "What specific action can you take next time to avoid making the mistake you just made?" they give me a very different response:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I can circle the exact thing the question is asking for."</li>
<li>"I can draw a picture instead of trying to imagine it in my head."</li>
<li>"I can read ALL the answer choices before I make a decision."</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on, but it just shows that <strong>there's a lot of specific things that can make a big difference. And it's a lot easier to remember to DO something than to just BE better or smarter or more careful.</strong></p>
<p>Relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>When my partner works a double, I can save questions about finances until the morning (as opposed to, "listen better").</li>
<li>If I need some space, I can ask for it directly instead of brooding and hoping he/she gets the idea (I even have a specific phrase so I know exactly what to say).</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I get to this point in the song, I can put one finger on the correct key for the next part before I need to play it (playing piano).</li>
<li>If I keep getting punched in the face, I can focus on tall posture and head movement before I worry about getting hits in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If my clients keep forgetting or cancelling appointments, I can set a reminder on my calendar to confirm with them the day before.</li>
<li>If I don't call them because it's too much trouble to look up their phone number, I can type their phone number into the appointment on the calendar so it pops up with the reminder to confirm.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all taken from my life, but the principles are the same: focus on what action you can take to avoid making the mistake. <strong>The more specific, the better.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use this technique to stop making the same mistakes over and over again...so you can make some new ones :).</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What mistakes keep reocurring in your life? What specific action can you take to avoid making that same mistake the next time you're in that situation?</strong></em></p>
