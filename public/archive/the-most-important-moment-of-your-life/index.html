It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.” - Aristotle</p></blockquote>
<p>Every moment of every day is full of choices. Some choices are trivial and some have life-altering consequences.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Laugh or get angry</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Eat healthy or eat conveniently</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Read or watch TV</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Walk or run</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Play or work</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Love or hate</span></li>
<li>Marriage or dating</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Create or consume</span></li>
<li>College or work</li>
<li>Write or don't</li>
</ul>
<h3>There are No Turning Points</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I often catch myself thinking that I need some big event to 'turn over a new leaf' or otherwise start living the life I want/being the person I want to be. I have this romantic idea that I need a crisis in which to make a big choice that defines my character.</span></p>
<p>But the truth is, those moments don't exist. Crises might <em>reveal</em> our character, but it is built day by day, by the little choices we make.</p>
<p>Even when we are <em>trapped</em> in a boring job or a crowded city, we can always choose how we respond to our situations, and that choice defines us a little bit each time we make it.</p>
<p>Of course, change is hard and it is always easier to look for excuses to justify the easy way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Day after day, we resolve to be more compassionate, or more patient, or more joyful, b</span>ut day after day, moment to moment, we decide that <em>this </em>situation is just too serious, or that right now, we're too tired to start changing things up.</p>
<p>So, instead of holding the door for the person behind us, we rush through, justifying it with our tight schedule. We put off that choice.</p>
<p><strong>We don't realize that we have a choice to be on a tight schedule, and we have a choice on how to respond to that. And all the little choices we made over the years about how we live our lives add up to this moment.</strong></p>
<p>The past is behind us. The future exists only in our imaginations. Only the present is real, and that is why <strong>the most important moment of our life is always <em>this</em> moment, full of infinite potential to change, to grow, to choose. It is the only one we have any control over</strong>.</p>
<h3>Choosing Inaction</h3>
<p>And of course, putting off a choice is a choice in and of itself; the decision to do nothing is still a decision, and it still has consequences. The decision to continue living our status quo is an active choice to accept what we have now.</p>
<p>Or to accept what others have decided for us.</p>
<p><strong>We <em>choose </em>our <a title="Priorities: Matching Reality to Your Values" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/priorities-matching-reality-to-your-values/" target="_blank">priorities</a>. Or else they are chosen for us.</strong></p>
<p>And the decision to become excellent, to live your bliss, isn't a once-in-a-lifetime choice.</p>
<p>It is a lifetime of choices. It is a choice you make every single moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing to be a writer consists of choosing to write each day, instead of choosing to not-write.</li>
<li>Choosing to become a great athlete means that, each day, you choose to train and work hard.</li>
<li>Choosing to be a great mother means that every single of the millions of times your children are a handful, you choose to handle them with grace and love.</li>
<li>Choosing to live with serenity means choosing to smile, laugh, and be grateful each time you're stuck in a traffic jam, faced with red tape, or otherwise stuck in a frustrating situation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Default Settings</h3>
<p>The alternative is the default choice: not-write, not-train, lose your temper, whine and complain.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe the default choice is made for you, as when your meal choices are limited by the availability of fresh produce, or maybe you instilled a habit long ago.</strong></p>
<p>Either way, just because it is the easy, non-thinking choice, doesn't mean it's not a decision. By simple inaction, you can choose to accept it.</p>
<p>The other option is to make a new default for yourself. Create a habit. Make it so you can't sleep at night until you've put in your 2000 words, or you've run your miles. Make patience your first reaction to a tantrum, and learn to laugh at every challenge life puts in your path.</p>
<h3>Habitual Excellence</h3>
<p><strong>It takes awareness to see the choices in every moment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It takes intention to apply the energy to make a decision.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Integrity is the result of consistency, and it is what gives you the strength to keep making the right choice.</strong></p>
<p>To paraphrase Aristotle a bit, Integrity is a habit.</p>
<p>How do you create a habit? How do you become a joyful person who laughs at frustration and exercises infinite patience with kids, who meditates daily and never thinks to touch junk food?</p>
<p>You make choices. Little ones. Consistently. Right now.</p>
<p>Go out there and change your world.</p>
<p><em><strong>What choices have you been putting off? What mindsets have you been cultivating by the choices (implicit or explicit) that you've been making?</strong></em></p>
