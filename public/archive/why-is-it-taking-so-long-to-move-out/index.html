<p>It is obviously a reach.</p>
<p>While I am not technically unemployed, I am still living at home, as are a number of my friends. And while I did find this video really funny, it struck home for me. I am a capable, ambitious young guy, so why am I still at home when I know a lot of my friends are living independently.</p>
<p><strong>Fear of the Unknown</strong></p>
<p>This is probably my biggest excuse. I admit that I’m scared of handling all my own stuff. And without my parents around, there isn’t that nice safety net.</p>
<p>Realistically though, I’ve pretty much managed to maintain my own finances without going broke. I do get free lodging and transportation though, which is a lot.</p>
<p><strong>It Takes Time to Set Up</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to work a regular corporate job. So I’m taking the time to establish myself as a freelancer and an entrepreneur. I know the American dream is to get a regular job and toil away in your spare hours to earn your freedom, but I don’t really have to do that, so why should I?</p>
<p>While this may seem like me being an overprivileged, white, middle-class snot, I can’t really justify hog-tying myself just to put myself on an equal playing field for the sake of appearances. By consolidating my resources, I can lay a really solid foundation and when it comes time to start my own business, I should be able to do so with a decent chance of success.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong. Perhaps not working a regular job is robbing me of the experiences I need to run a business. We’ll see soon enough I guess.</p>
<p><strong>No Guidebook</strong></p>
<p>Because I didn’t follow the traditional model of go to school-graduate-get a regular job, I don’t really have a laid out path to follow. A big part of my inertia is the result of simply not knowing how to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Laziness</strong></p>
<p>And a big part of my inertia is the fact that I don’t have to proceed at this point.</p>
<p>Until I got that kick in the pants. Now I feel pretty lame living at my parents house (don’t get me wrong, they are wonderful people, I will be paying rent in a month, and I contribute resources and effort when I can). It is long past time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>So What Has Changed?</strong></p>
<p>Thinking about my priorities, moving out wasn’t really at the top of the list. I realized, however, that it would be much easier to accomplish the others if I did move out, because living on my own would also mean I had the resources to pursue other projects as well.</p>
<p>So I started thinking objectively. What do I need to do to get out?</p>
<p>Make more money was the biggest thing. I can’t afford an apartment in the area I live right now, but I am pretty close.</p>
<p>The best way I can think of to make money without sacrificing my soul is to pursue an independent business that I am interested in and which I can run on my own terms. So I need to take some initiative. I’ve been talking about starting my own small business for a long time, and nothing ever gets done. I aim to change that, starting now.</p>
<p>The biggest holes in my plan, as I pointed out above, were lack of knowledge, and fear. I think I’ve gotten to the point where frustration overcomes fear, and I have decided that the best way to remedy a lack of knowledge is to just start trying things and learn as I go. Clearly, I’m not learning what I need to by reading empowerment blogs…</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to put that out there. I’m still working on a lot of pretty basic things. I am a little ashamed that I’m still living with my parents, even though I’ve done really well in terms of gainful employment. Hopefully, I can turn that into positive motivation to start the ball rolling.</p>
<p><strong>Fight on, Brave Warrior!</strong></p>
