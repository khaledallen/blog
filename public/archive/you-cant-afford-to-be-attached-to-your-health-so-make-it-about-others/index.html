<h3>The Spiritual Path is Taken For Others</h3>
<p>In Buddhism, enlightenment is not something to be pursued for the spiritual seeker himself. In fact, if your purpose in seeking enlightenment is personal in any way, you wonâ€™t reach it. Even if all you seek is to be free of your personal troubles, that is not the right reason.</p>
<p>Once Buddha attained <em>nirvana</em>, he went out to teach it to the world. <strong>The tradition of the Bodhisattva is one of service; seek enlightenment to ease the suffering of others.</strong></p>
<p>The point of enlightenment in the Buddhist tradition is not to become a spiritual badass or be free of suffering. It is very distinctly to become a guide for others on the path to freedom for suffering.</p>
<p>Similarly, I believe that the point of any self-development should ultimately serve others, even one so mundane as physical health. The point of health is not to be a fitness badass. It isn't even just to be free of disease; we want to <a title="Your Mountain is Waiting. Do You Dare Conquer it?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/your-mountain-is-waiting-do-you-dare-conquer-it/">build something</a>, not just avoid misfortune.</p>
<p><strong>The point of good health is specifically to be useful to others. Otherwise, our lives and influence ends when we do. Only by working to make the world a better place can we end up with anything other than a <a title="How Much Do You Cost? How Much Do You Create?" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-much-do-you-cost-how-much-do-you-create/">final balance of zero</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>The Benefits of Your Health to Other People</h3>
<p>Some ways being healthy helps you serve others:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious way, if you're strong and vital, you can work harder and longer, and you can carry others or their burdens, literally and figuratively.</li>
<li>When you're healthy, you don't get sick as often, so you can be counted on to be where you promised, when you promised, and to be fully present.</li>
<li>When you're comfortable with your body, you have the confidence and emotional strength to be more sociable, compassionate, and supportive of others.</li>
<li>When you <a title="The One Thing You Can Do To Make Everything Better" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-one-thing-you-can-do-to-make-everything-better/">take care of your health</a>, others don't have to, so you are less of a burden. You can dedicate yourself to helping others because you're not always nursing your own suffering.</li>
<li>Your energy becomes infectious. You inspire others to approach life with more vitality.</li>
<li>You are simply more pleasant to be around than if you were not healthy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Strength of the Tribe is the Strength of the Individual</h3>
<p>The Warrior, more than any other member of the tribe, needs to be prepared to serve it, to fight its battles, and to defend it against external threats. That's why <a title="Heroes are Rare" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/heroes-are-rare/">heroes are so rare</a>. So the Warrior must always aspire to fulfill his or her potential. Since the Warrior is a product of the tribe, any opportunity is provided by the tribe, with the expectation that, in exchange for empowering the Warrior, the Warrior will return the gift.</p>
<p>Your tribe is whatever you want: your family, your city, your country, your people, your planet, karma, complex bio-ecological interactions, god, the collective social unconscious, the universal one, all life, all existence.</p>
<p>We are equipped to better the world, if only we can get past our self-centeredness to do it. In this perspective, everything we are, everything we have, and everything we can be, is a gift. <strong>We are privileged to serve the betterment of the world with the gifts the world granted us.</strong></p>
<p>No pressure ;-)</p>
<p><em>One small way I am trying to make my health benefit others is by sharing what I've learned in the form of a short book on a compassionate, personally empowering approach to fitness. Please <a title="Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health" href="http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/">check it out</a> if you'd like to learn how to be your best, healthiest self.</em></p>
