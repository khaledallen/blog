      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for a coding interview recently, and as a result I have given a lot of thought to how I tend to solve problems.
When I started back in to school, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great problem-solving process. I had always been &amp;ldquo;the smart kid&amp;rdquo; and didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything special that I was aware of in order to solve most of the problems I encountered. The only exception to that was some of the very difficult games I like to play.</description>

      <description>Using this tutorial to learn Kubernetes concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do. minikube needs to run in a virtual environment, so we need to specify the vm-driver, hypberkit in our case.
minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit
Once minikube is set up, it spins up a VM and then you can use kubectl to query it. Minikube is a node, running virtually in your own computer.
Basic Commands Usage creat a pod: kubectl create .... We don&amp;rsquo;t notmally work with pods directly.</description>

      <title>How I Avoided Becoming the Flavor-of-the-Month Intern</title>

      <description>Last year, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at a NASA center. They were looking for someone with JavaScript experience to update a data collections tool that had been underutilized because it was not searchable and had a poor UI. The plan was to rebuild it with a shiny new graph-based database and to update the frontend to use React. Basically, modernize it and clean it up.
All this was what my supervisors and their bosses wanted.</description>

      <description>We have a new cat whose name is probably the most on-the-nose name a cat can have: Misjif. He&amp;rsquo;s so mischievious he even spelled mischief wrong.
Take all the things that make cats cat-like&amp;ndash;climbs everything, yowls in the middle of the night, clever in all the wrong ways, velociraptor-like learning curve and love of mayhem&amp;ndash;and turn them up to CAT. That is Misjif. Also cute. He&amp;rsquo;s stinkin&#39; adorable, which makes all of this worse: you can&amp;rsquo;t stay mad at him (though trust me I&amp;rsquo;m working really hard on that).</description>

      <description>When I started learning to bake bread, I used active dry yeast. It was easy and with the right recipe, I could get reasonably good results without all the complications of a sourdough starter. But I always aspired to make bread with the starter, and for a while, I believed that using a starter was the only real way to make bread. I also thought that once I moved to using a starter, I would never make bread the &amp;ldquo;easy way&amp;rdquo; again.</description>

      <description>In 2013, I decided to stop writing regularly in my blog, which I had been posting to daily since 2009 when I graduated college. I had what should have felt like success with a reasonable audience, an ebook and launch, collaborations, guest posts, even some money from my writing.
Then, in 2013 I stopped abruptly. I suddenly found the act of expressing my opinions offensive and exhausting, just a lot of ego-stroking.</description>

      <title>Why Nobody Else Can Teach You How to Be Happy</title>

      <description>There are only three books I have read more than once.
Lord of the Rings: three times
Dune: three times
The last is the one book I keep coming back to: Siddhartha, by Herman Hesse.
If you aren’t familiar with it, it is the story of a Brahmin’s (priest’s) son who, thirsty for knowledge of truth, leaves his class to pursue knowledge any way he can, becoming an ascetic, then becoming a wealthy merchant and aesthete, then abandoning all that with the intention to commit suicide, until, eventually, near the end of his life, attaining awakening.</description>

      <title>Signs Your Team is Making Stupid Decisions, and How to Fix It</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/signs-team-making-stupid-decisions-fix/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/signs-team-making-stupid-decisions-fix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We normally think that a group of people is more effective than a single individual. That’s why we form teams, companies, and nations, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that groups can, and often do, make worse decisions than individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best examples of this comes from the Kennedy Administrations. Here, you find a team of some of the smartest people in the world making one of the worst decisions in modern history: The Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-smartest-people-making-a-stupid-decision&#34;&gt;The Smartest People Making a Stupid Decision&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was elated from his recent electoral victory, and there was a general sense of the need to support him, a new president, among his staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did they end up signing off of what became the most embarrassing moment of his career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His advisors influenced one another to openly support Kennedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this atmosphere of public agreement, they all suppressed their personal objections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of three reports that did voice objections, one was kept from the President, and the other two held by him from his staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they made their final decision, the group voted publicly, adding pressure to show support for their leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And so it seemed that everyone was in agreement: it was a good idea to invade Cuba with an under-supported, outnumbered force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by the enthusiastic support of his own most trusted advisors, even a great leader might question his own reservations about a bad plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Starting From Scratch...Again</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/starting-from-scratch-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/starting-from-scratch-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beginnings are hard, but there is something especially hard about starting again something you used to be good at. When you are a beginner, you expect things to be hard, and while you may not like being bad at a new skill, you accept that it&#39;s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you used to be really good at something and are now out of practice, it can be very difficult to come to terms with re-learning all over again. You&#39;re used to a certain level of performance, you already put in the work, and you may even feel the same sense of confidence as before despite your actual performance. Maybe the words just won&#39;t form themselves on the page like they used to, or your fingers can&#39;t find the right keys, or you&#39;re just in a different place and have trouble connecting that to your writing or your music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, once you get the ball rolling again, you&#39;ll usually learn faster to get back to where you were. After all, the practice is now just about reviving old techniques and habits rather than creating entirely new ones. Depending on how good you were, and how long it&#39;s been since you last wrote or played or ran or lifted or sang, that catch up period can take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since it&#39;s all ground you&#39;ve already traveled, it can feel especially tedious, lacking the excitement and fascination it held the first time you were discovering it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hatred is a Choice</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/hatred-is-a-choice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/hatred-is-a-choice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hatred is a seductive emotion. It masquerades as righteousness. It suggests that without it, we would be apathetic, cowardly, acquiescent, poor defenders of justice and easy prey for our enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the most appropriate thing in the world to hate that which we know is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a right to hatred, it is my mother. In 1948, my mother&#39;s family was evicted from their home in Palestine at gunpoint. She grew up in Gaza for years before her father was able to move the family to Kuwait where they lived without citizenship.</description>

      <title>I Won’t Be the Reason This Doesn’t Work Out</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/i-wont-be-the-reason-this-doesnt-work-out/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished Cal Newport’s book, &lt;em&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/em&gt;. The title is a little misleading: the book &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; about a commitment to quality work, but it really addresses the question of how to decide what to do with your life. The conclusion Newport provides is that “follow your passion” is terrible advice and a surefire way to end up miserable. There’s a lot more to the book than I will touch on here (so go read it), but it stimulated some thoughts I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How I “found my passion” by giving up on looking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I moved to Boulder, the first job I got was as an academic tutor at a boutique tutoring outfit. I’ll admit that, at the time, I thought this job was beneath me, a graduate of UChicago, but it paid well and I genuinely loved helping people. Ironically it was my academic history, grades and SAT scores that qualified me at all, so it was by definition NOT beneath me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent about eighteen months hating my job, routinely missing or being late for appointments, and generally failing to take it seriously. In my mind, it wasn’t a real job, just a stopgap while I found something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never did find anything better. I remember being so angry at the world for letting me down and myself for not doing better. I saw many of my friends in high-caliber jobs, doing things they loved, and I felt like I had missed my chance. I even went back to New York for a while to try starting from scratch where I’d grown up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tutoring, however, I had/have two of the greatest bosses anyone could ask for, who, despite my recalcitrance and lack of consistency, continued to give me students, to work with me, and to pay me better than anything else I found in Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got fed up with being angry about my life and decided that, if this was the best job I was going to get, then I would just be the best tutor I could be. At least I could be proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Going Broad Helps you Go Deep</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/going-broad-helps-go-deep/</link>

      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I work several jobs, so I am in the interesting position of being able to introduce myself as “front end developer,” “tutor,” “product manager,” or even “startup founder.” I used to worry it demonstrated a lack of focus, but I&#39;ve come to a different perspective. I no longer see it as a lack of focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;p3&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I see it as a strong commitment to being well-rounded.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I have found that having so many different areas of interest has allowed for tons of cross-pollination. My self-taught web development skills inform my teaching, which in turn makes me a much better business owner and partner. I am a more creative writer, able to draw in experiences from a variety of fields to try to illustrate my points. Because I&#39;ve taught myself so many of my skills, I am very good at explaining them to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;The conventional wisdom is that you have the option of either being decent at many things or really good at one thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&#34;p3&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have a different model: Being really good at anything actually depends on being decent at a number of things.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>I Don’t Know: The Power that Comes From Letting Go of “Smart”</title>

      <description>A story I tell my students to help them experiment more in their thinking is that the biggest mistake I made in school was being “a straight-A student.”
I defined myself as very smart, which meant that I had to get good grades all the time. If I messed up or made a mistake, that would mean I wasn’t smart.
So I did everything I could do to look smart. I put all my energy into understanding the expectations of the assignments and then met them exactly.</description>

      <description>In high school, I once worked on a game setting for 4 hours straight, typing so furiously I broke my. In college, I once spent 3 days writing constantly in 6 and 4 hour blocks, with breaks only for food and sleep.
Nowadays, however, I can’t imagine engineering that sort unbroken focus.
It’s not just the lack of time but also the fact that I don’t think I could sustain my attention for that long.</description>

 Today, I want to share one of the most harrowing experiences of my life: learning to type in a new layout.
Voluntary Lobotomy This is a lot scarier than it sounds. Imagine losing part of your brain without realizing it. Then, when you go to do something you have always been able to do easily.</description>

      <title>The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/integrity/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/integrity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is one of Warrior Spirit&#39;s favorites that the server disapparated somehow. It&#39;s one of my earliest articles, and much of my thinking has developed, but it still expresses the core ideas really well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.” - General Norman Schwarzkopf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is largely about the development of character. The most important quality of character is integrity, because without it, character has no meaning. So what is integrity, anyway? The word is vaguely defined in most discussions, and looking back over my posts, I realize I have never actually clarified what it is I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrity as Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;calls integrity &#34;a concept of consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations and outcomes.&#34; This is still a pretty vague definition, but the basic idea is that integrity is the quality of consistency in character; you act as you believe, and your values match your behavior. Basically, the opposite of hypocrisy. Integrity in this sense allows for the integrity of really evil people. The argument is that a person can have integrity so long as their actions match their chosen belief or ethical system. It doesn&#39;t matter &lt;em&gt;what &lt;/em&gt;that ethical system is, so long as their actions are in line with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrity as Wholeness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take issue with this idea that integrity can apply to evil characters. (Since I have some philosophically inclined readers I will add a note that I am aware of the dangers of calling anything evil without defining that term. Without getting too much into my ethics, what is and is not evil is based on what is and is not conducive to peace and life. Those who murder, rape, delight in the suffering of others, and partake in other depravities are definitively evil). My thoughts and readings on human psychology and spirit suggest that &lt;strong&gt;in order for a human being to have integrity, it must behave in ways that promote peace and life, and which reduce suffering&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply having an evil internal value system itself undermines integrity. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary &lt;/a&gt;defines integrity thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic values &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; incorruptibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an unimpaired condition &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; soundness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the quality or state of being complete or undivided &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;completeness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d argue that soundness or completeness in the human being necessitates a value system of compassion and kindness; &lt;strong&gt;that is, a complete human being is a good one.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrity is the link between action and belief. It is what lets a person with good values realize his or her values, and thus become whole.</description>

      <title>A Month of Illiteracy</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-month-of-illiteracy/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-month-of-illiteracy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last three weeks, I&#39;ve been learning how to type all over again, since I transitioned to to a new keyboard layout. Which is why there haven&#39;t been any blog posts, since writing one would have taken me approximately ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still getting back to where I was, but I&#39;m finally at the point where I can manage sentences. It&#39;s been interesting being bad at something that I&#39;ve taken for granted for so long: I have known how to touch type for as long as I can remember so I&#39;ve never known a time when typing was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being bad at typing has impacted the way I think in type&lt;/strong&gt;. My thoughts are simpler and more constrained because there is so much effort associated with typing. I lack the capability to express accurately my thoughts in writing, and I catch myself feeling stupid. It&#39;s just such a slog to type.</description>

      <title>How Playing Like You Could Lose, Helps You Win</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-playing-like-you-could-lose-helps-you-win/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I played a game of chess in which I managed to get two queens on the board. I thought I had the game in the bag at that point, so of course I didn&#39;t notice that my opponent was one move away from checkmate. As soon as his king got space for a breath, he made that move and mated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, honestly, I knew being so far ahead was dangerous for me. I know I tend to get cocky, overextend, and expose myself. I forget to cover the basics like king safety and developing other pieces. I go for flashy moves. I doubt I&#39;m unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biking home, I kept trying to pull out a lesson from the game, but couldn&#39;t really come up with it. Wanting to end the night on a win, I loaded up chess.com and played a couple games. The first game I won in the same way I lost earlier: I was on my heels, but my online opponent had left a weak pawn unguarded and I mated him out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He challenged me to another game, and I knew I was in danger of getting cocky. I had just won, so I was feeling good. I knew I could win. I wanted to win. I was good enough to win! I was gonna win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But then I thought back to earlier in the evening. I needed some mindset that didn&#39;t downplay my ability but also kept me level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how I approach martial arts. Grappling with my instructor, I never entertain the idea that he doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m up to (since he taught me everything), so I always roll with the knowledge that losing is a very real outcome. The result is that I grapple better (I still lose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t always bring that mindset to peers, but why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to play chess as if I might lose, as if I was playing a grandmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I won.</description>

      <title>How Creativity and Expertise is All About the Right Framework</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/creativity-expertise-framework/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/creativity-expertise-framework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend creates large, complex mandalas, which are impossible to draw freehand. Because of their complexity, they require a lot of planning. She can spend days just drawing guides, measuring angles, and sketching in fills to make sure everything will fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought this was very unartistic, as if the act of planning made them less creative. I always envisioned art as something that was intuitive and spontaneous. I had the view that creative people just pulled their craft from their head, and if you had to outline it, you weren&#39;t the real deal. That&#39;s probably why I resisted outlining my novels for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she developed as an artist, not only were her mandalas becoming more complex, the frameworks she was using were evolving also. She was invested in improving her planning methods, not just the results of her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From that, I learned that the frameworks we use (and whether we allow ourselves to use frameworks at all) are directly connected to our ability to create meaningful, creative, and useful work in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began to look for other kinds of art in which arrangement was key to the creation of beauty and meaning, I discovered it was harder to find creative work that &lt;em&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; require this kind of meticulous planning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music is the arrangement of tones into meaningful &#39;songs&#39; (even the song &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;4&#39;33&#34;, the silent composition by John Cage,&lt;/a&gt; imposes arrangement by specifying the duration and context of the piece). Improvisational folk music relies on preexisting frameworks and agreed-upon conventions, so it is still highly arranged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photography is arrangement through composition and exclusion. By framing a photo, you provide the viewer with some basis for deriving meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novel writing is the arrangement of events into meaningful &#39;stories&#39;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dance is the arrangement of movement in a way that connects with the song and the dancer&#39;s expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meaning and Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, art is anything that gives meaning to &#39;stuff&#39;--materials, knowledge, events, sounds, ideas, information, etc--turning it from its raw state into something that is relate-able to humans. Good art is well-arranged, and bad art is poorly arranged, at least in relation to its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a beautiful car is perfectly and efficiently arranged in a way that is in agreement with its significance, whether that&#39;s driving fast or hauling. An ugly car is not, and makes concessions to things like profit, planned-obsolescence, or convenience. It is closer to being meaningless in terms of what it was meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning can even be indecipherable or non-explainable, as in the case of some modern art; the very act of putting something in a gallery can give it meaning, as many modern artists have demonstrated, even if that meaning is not something we can put our fingers on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if all art requires arrangement to some degree, then arrangement, meaning-making, and art are basically the same thing--arrangement of the world into something meaningful--and the more masterful someone is at their craft, the better they are at organizing knowledge so that it can be interacted with in a meaningful way.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Teaching Personal Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/teaching-personal-responsibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/teaching-personal-responsibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching (or any kind of leadership) is one of the most exhausting jobs you can do, but every good teacher will tell you, the real work is done by the student.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&#39;re not officially a teacher, tutor, leader, coach or therapist, you probably want to help those you care about grow. But there&#39;s a fine line between telling someone what to do and helping them explore their own growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side of that line is the drudgery we all associate with traditional education: busywork, pointless assignments, teachers who don&#39;t tolerate outside-the-box thinking. On the other side is the opportunity to become our greatest selves and see others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally have students whose parents sit in during tutoring, and at the end of one of my sessions, a mom thanked me for all my hard work. I immediately (automatically) pointed out that her daughter was the one doing the real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had moved from around the 50th percentile to the 90th. She never fails to do her homework. She has mastered every strategy and technique I&#39;ve shown her. To do that, I know she must be putting in hours at home for every hour she meets with me, on top of her school work and extracurriculars. She&#39;s a star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And SHE and her mom are thanking ME for my hard work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that I was trying to be modest; I honestly believe that my students carry the lion&#39;s share of the burden in our work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I may be valuable, unique, critical even, but the student is essential to his or her own success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use Your Limitations as Power-Ups</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-use-your-limitations-as-power-ups/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-use-your-limitations-as-power-ups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best and worst thing about being human is that you get to be great and imperfect at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love martial arts, movement, fitness, everything to do with athleticism, but very early in my martial arts career, I tore my right pelvic labrum, the ligaments that hold my leg in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not debilitating, but it hurts pretty much all the time, especially when I do a lot of the things I love. It doesn’t limit my range of motion, but it makes kicks and grappling uncomfortable. Even running takes its toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which is weird, in a way, that I can love something so much I’ll do it even when it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to deal with it with characteristic stubbornness. I would work through it until my hip finally gave out. I used to think I could change it with determination, therapy, training, technique, persistence, diet, etc, etc, etc. Surgery even, though no doctor has recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really, I resented the fact that my hip would never work right. It made me feel broken and it felt unfair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strategic Lessons from Jane Austen and Marvel&#39;s The Avengers</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/strategic-lessons-from-jane-austen-and-marvels-the-avengers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/strategic-lessons-from-jane-austen-and-marvels-the-avengers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always had trouble reading chick-lit (probably because I called it that). Jane Austen, while not entirely chick-lit, fell into the box I&#39;d created. She was entertaining, but not really substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I discovered what she&#39;s really about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend lent me a book called &lt;em&gt;Jane Austen: Game Theorist,&lt;/em&gt; in which the author argues that &lt;strong&gt;all of Austen&#39;s works are basically a theoretical exploration of strategy, and makes a very good case for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy? Like chess, martial arts, StarCraft, and naval maneuvers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Actually, this isn&#39;t new. &lt;strong&gt;Strategic thinking is the ability to account for others&#39; preferences and potential actions&lt;/strong&gt;, and its known that reading novels improves that skill. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/04/29/why-men-should-read-more-fiction/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Art of Manliness has an article on why men should read more novels&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and at the time, it seemed like simply a clever romance. But now, with new eyes, I found the book revealed layers of strategic insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even watched &lt;em&gt;Clueless &lt;/em&gt;(a modern remake of &lt;em&gt;Emma), &lt;/em&gt;and the BBC miniseries of &lt;em&gt;Emma,&lt;/em&gt; to see if the strategic insights carried over. And they do, right there in an LA high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These books basically teach you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why strategy isn&#39;t always competitive:&lt;/strong&gt; others&#39; preferences may be in line with yours, but circumstances prevent them from acting. You can help things along, or even collaborate with others to make things work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to figure out what people are motivated by:&lt;/strong&gt; analyze their past choices, and pay attention to their eyes and body language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to influence people:&lt;/strong&gt; re-frame social situations to allow them to express themselves in ways you or they want, help them see how their preferences are connected to the things you want them to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How strategic thinking can be considerate:&lt;/strong&gt; manipulating a situation to help someone avoid embarrassment or offending, giving them the opportunity to purse what they want. Many people are short-sighted about their own interests and make short-term decisions that prevent them from pursuing their long-term happiness. You can help them avoid that, but you have to know what they want first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What cluelessness looks like, and why it&#39;s so cringe-worthy:&lt;/strong&gt; clueless people make everyone uncomfortable and tend to highlight others&#39; shortcomings as well as their own by failing to read social cues. They also fail to connect with us, which makes us feel bad, since humans crave connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really excited about the possibilities for exploring this skillset, especially since the section on cluelessness hit close to home for me, and is something I&#39;ve worked my whole life to overcome. Happily, Austen&#39;s characters point out that it just takes practice.</description>

      <title>&#34;I want...&#34;</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/i-want/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/i-want/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#34;I want.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you said those words in such a direct way? I thought it sounded childish just typing it, the mantra of a two year old child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visited my aunt in Jordan, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to say, &#34;May I please have the X?&#34; in Arabic. She explained to me the Arabic phrase I should use if I wanted something: &#34;biddi,&#34; which is colloquial Jordanian for &#34;I want.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was extremely uncomfortable using this phrase. I felt like a selfish brat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want bread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to go to the park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to sleep now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There was no &#34;please&#34; or &#34;can I,&#34; Just my raw desires placed in front of my family for them to acknowledge or refuse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nobody took it rudely. It was simply how you asked for things -- by stating your wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the other person did with that information was up to them, but they generally assumed I was not being pushy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the States, if you say, &#34;I want X,&#34; people will give you nasty looks. &#34;What&#39;s the magic word?&#34; As if simply expressing your wants without some account for another&#39;s possible feelings is the epitome of rudeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after my experience in Jordan, I wondered why we think simply expressing wants is considered rude. You have to coat it in all these other phrases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you mind…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would prefer…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;d be cool if…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seems very British to me, very indirect. Guess vs ask culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with &#34;please.&#34; That&#39;s our culture. If you don&#39;t say, &#34;please,&#34; it sends a very specific kind of message about how you think of the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not one of those who thinks words are everything. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/never-apologize-2/&#34;&gt;Sorry isn&#39;t always an apology&lt;/a&gt;. But if you aren&#39;t conscious of the words you use, they can certainly come to define the way you think, and this is a great example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Steps to Patch a Rocky Relationship</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/patch-relationship/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/patch-relationship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Relationships take work, and sometimes, tensions aren&#39;t dealt with, leading to a classic white elephant situation, or a more serious distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens to a relationship, it sucks: you don&#39;t know whether to bring up the issue or just hope it blows over. Sometimes, you wonder if it&#39;s just you and the other person has no idea, or if they&#39;re being mean and keeping you in suspense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they aren&#39;t aware there&#39;s a problem on your end, it can still eat you up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s best to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, before they fester and the thought of continuing on in a cold, distant, resentful relationship is worse than just abandoning it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think swallowing your pride and just offering an apology is the go-to solution for all relationship conflicts. But here&#39;s why that might not be a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be quick to offer apologies in every conflict, taking the blame for things I didn&#39;t do just to smooth things over. My girlfriends would be upset about something that happened in class and they&#39;d snap at me, then I&#39;d come back and apologize for not reading their minds, desperate for things to just go back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did often smooth things over, but it was just a band-aid and it left me with a bitter taste about the relationship and told the other person they could act however they wanted because I&#39;d do all the legwork to make things okay again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That just led to a roller-coaster of conflict, apology, resentment, conflict, apology, resentment, until we broke up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my friends, I&#39;d eventually just grow distant, and with my family, we just argued a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t until last year that I learned how to own my side of a conflict without just brushing the rest under the rug. I&#39;ve been able to reconnect with family members, repair a strained friendship, and actually cultivate a stronger sense of self-advocacy instead of becoming a doormat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Cultivate a Growth Mindset</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/growth-mindset/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a tutor, I sometimes get the chance to work with really bright, motivated students. You&#39;d think they would be the easiest to teach, but sometimes they&#39;re actually the most frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I sometimes get kids whose scores showed that they really struggle with a lot of the material. I used to worry that teaching these kids would be frustrating, but that wasn&#39;t always the case either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, neither &#34;smart&#34; kids nor &#34;slow&#34; kids were more or less successful. Teaching some smart kids was like pulling teeth, and there were slow kids who were a joy to work with. What made a successful student and made the teaching experience more rewarding wasn&#39;t their intelligence. It wasn&#39;t even work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made the biggest difference, by an order of magnitude, was a willingness to question assumptions and try on new ways of thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow kids who dedicated little time to their studies improved faster than smart kids who did every homework assignment as long as they did the homework in the way I told them: using the new, uncomfortable approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was often the &#34;slower&#34; students who improved the most and ultimately accomplished their goals because they were quicker to accept that they needed to change their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smarter students knew they&#39;re smart and felt like what they&#39;d been doing had been working. So when they came to me, they were just looking for more of the same. They were reluctant to change their approach, and so they failed to make the breakthroughs they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you combine those three things--intelligence, strong work ethic, and a willingness to stretch your comfort zone--you have a recipe for powerful learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What You Should Never Apologize For, and What You Should</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/never-apologize-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/never-apologize-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wanna hear an embarrassing story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first high school girlfriend engineered an entire evening to get me alone at her place to make out, but I was so inexperienced and shy, I bolted: &#34;Huh, everyone else went home, I guess I should probably head out then, g&#39;night!&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She legitimately pointed out that she just wanted to have a fun summer and didn&#39;t really want to spend it waiting for me to catch up. I apologized for feeling shy and scared, but it ended anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar thing happened with my next two girlfriends, and the lesson I learned was that my feelings were keeping me from happiness. The solution, I thought, was to deny them, all the while hating myself for having them. I lived in a constant state of apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I apologized for everything: what I did, what I said, and worst of all, what I felt, wanted, and who I was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I apologized for wanting too little intimacy, or too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I apologized for having certain thoughts, or not having them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I apologized for being good at some skills and bad at others. I apologized for feeling anything that I thought might rock the boat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I apologized for not being &#34;a better boyfriend,&#34; and sometimes even for being &#34;a good boyfriend.&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would deny my feelings until they broke through, then I&#39;d just apologize and feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, my partners didn&#39;t appreciate that. The self-denial felt fake, and when things broke down and my true feelings/nature shone through, it seemed like I&#39;d been lying to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mindset infected the way I thought about myself. I would feel something and immediately think, &#34;I shouldn&#39;t feel that. I must be a bad person.&#34; Or I&#39;d see a Tesla drive by and feel guilty for wanting something so &#34;extravagant.&#34; If a personality trait of mine caused conflict, I&#39;d feel like there was something wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things got better eventually, but contemplating marriage, my network of friends and supporters helped me realize things would be very rough if I didn&#39;t deal with this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then one day, on a long run after a hard talk with my fiance, I realized I couldn&#39;t live like that and have the life I wanted. I made a vow never to apologize for who I am, what I desire, or how I feel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all my relationships, with friends, family, my fiance, and myself, improved immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make Everything Easier: Get More Mental Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/mental-bandwidth/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/mental-bandwidth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was experiencing what felt like extreme financial scarcity. I was constantly worried about paying my bills and my income was dwindling month after month. I knew &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I should do to make things better--put in more hours freelancing, maybe pick up another job to tide me over--but I just couldn&#39;t to get myself to actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt like I didn&#39;t have the time and I was mentally checked out a lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I picked up the book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/scarcity-sendhil-mullainathan/1114258421?ean=9781250056115&amp;amp;st=PLA&amp;amp;sid=BNB_DRS_Core+Shopping+Books_00000000&amp;amp;2sid=Google_&amp;amp;sourceId=PLGoP345&amp;amp;k_clickid=3x345&amp;amp;kpid=9781250056115&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scarcity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;by &lt;span class=&#34;contributors&#34;&gt;Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir&lt;/span&gt;. More on the details below, but it helped me realize my problem was mostly in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, I didn&#39;t really have an objective financial problem: I was paying my rent and bills. I just &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; a sense of scarcity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I tricked myself into feeling the opposite. I allowed myself to make some purchases I&#39;d been deferring until I &#34;had more money.&#34; Almost immediately, I felt the mental fog lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired, I identified some regular activities that I knew helped me be present--meditation, morning runs, journaling at night--and made a point of doing them daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within days, I felt better. Within a week, I was taking consistent action to increase my income. Within a month, I had another job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And within two months, I had revamped Warrior Spirit to launch this site and quit my new side job because I&#39;d already found better opportunities, and doubled my monthly income.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because I found some small things to do to increase the mental bandwidth I had available on a given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the way, it&#39;s things like this that led me to believe the key to changing the world is to develop internal resources first, rather than hacking externals or tips and tricks (which I still enjoy and share when I can).</description>

      <title>How to Face Your Inner Demons to Get Unstuck</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/demons/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/demons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published on Warrior Spirit, my old blog. It struck a chord with a lot of folks, and it deals with the challenges of growth and the journey of learning, so I&#39;m reviving it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Yesterday, I brought up the reality that we all have &lt;a title=&#34;The Hard Questions&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p15g8X-Po&#34;&gt;troubling questions&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;d rather not deal with in our lives, demons that give us excuses to be complacent or hold ourselves back. To answer them is to face our own &lt;a title=&#34;Insecurity, the Root of All Evil&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/&#34;&gt;insecurities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/&#34;&gt;weaknesses&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I&#39;m going to dissect those demons so we can vanquish them and pursue our heroic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Many of these hard questions involve questioning the investment. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Am I really happy in this relationship?&#34; -- If the answer is no, it would mean ending a long-term emotional, time, and material investment. If we know the answer will be &#39;no,&#39; we may avoid asking the question at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Why do I stay at a job I hate?&#34; -- The answer to this question often reveals perceived character flaws, things we&#39;d rather not believe about ourselves. Maybe we believe we aren&#39;t qualified for anything better, or we think quitting would make us look bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;People are reluctant to break up long-term relationships because they’ve already invested so much in them, or they are afraid to quit a job because they worked so hard to get it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A Choose-Your-Own-Reality Adventure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Why can&#39;t we just see an obvious answer, internalize it, and act on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The best explanation comes from a psychological theory called cognitive dissonance, which just sounds uncomfortable. It posits that humans have a natural inclination to seek consistency in our lives and actions. If we detect an inconsistency, we feel cognitive stress, which can manifest in a variety of ways from general anxiety up to psychosomatic disorders. Naturally, we will work to eliminate it, even if that means changing our beliefs (which is what the demons of mediocrity want). If we are successful, we can avoid the stress, but some things cannot be hidden, so even if we refuse to acknowledge them consciously, we still know there is an inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The classic illustration of this is Aesop&#39;s fable, &#34;The Fox and the Grapes&#34;:</description>

      <title>Why Some Skills are Harder to Learn than Others</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-some-skills-are-harder-to-learn-than-others/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-some-skills-are-harder-to-learn-than-others/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something you&#39;ve always wanted to learn but haven&#39;t gotten around to? Why not? What keeps you from learning a particular skill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I graduated college, I realized (through a series of painful misadventures) that I was really unskilled when it came to women and relationships. I had met and dated great women, but had let myself be treated like a doormat. I couldn&#39;t approach the women I wanted to meet, and I knew that even if I did, I wouldn&#39;t be able to hold my own and earn their respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to learn one of the most difficult things I&#39;ve ever learned: how to make friends out of complete strangers. Cut to me making a fool of myself in bars across Connecticut and New York until I finally started making some real connections. That year was full of self-doubt, constant anxiety, exhaustion, lots of rejection, and forcing myself to do things I always avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was HARD! In the way that going to the dentist to have your wisdom teeth removed is hard: you don&#39;t want to do it, and when you finally get around it it, it&#39;s worse than you thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Making the Same Mistakes With This Simple Question</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/stop-making-the-same-mistakes-with-this-simple-question/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/stop-making-the-same-mistakes-with-this-simple-question/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t really mind getting punched in the face. What bothered me was that it happened so often, like I was inviting it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how hard I tried, my sparring partner always managed to find my face. In fact, even when he was backpedaling, his random flailing always seemed to land. Eventually, he hit me hard enough to start a nosebleed and we stopped the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was really frustrated! I had been training for a while and I felt like I should be better at defense than I was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vowed to try harder next time, but when the next sparring session came around, the same thing happened: I landed a few good hits, but everything my opponent threw found its way to my head. In fact, it was easier for him to hit my head than my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I buckled down, gritted my teeth, and went harder. Maybe he was just more aggressive than me and was trying harder to land good hits. So dove at him...right into his fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally went to my instructor. He asked me to spar with him and he immediately pointed out that I was leaning forward, sticking my nose out, and I wasn&#39;t moving my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two very specific things I could correct. Immediately, my performance improved because I had two concrete actions I could take to overcome my mistake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all make mistakes when learning, and most of the time, we&#39;re fine with that. Where people start to lose heart is when they make the same mistakes over and over again.</description>

      <title>How You Can Use Games to Make Learning Easier</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-you-can-use-games-to-make-learning-easier/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-you-can-use-games-to-make-learning-easier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember dying of dysentery on Oregon Trail, that game that was supposed to teach you about the history of the pioneers who opened up the frontier? How much besides that do you remember about it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask most people, they mainly remember dying of diseases, losing gear trying to cross rivers, and that it was very easy to shoot buffalo. They don&#39;t remember most of the historical context of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The game was meant to teach the history of the trail (I assume), but what it actually taught was the mindset and priorities of a pioneer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s easier to shoot buffalo than to buy and carry food all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The worst thing that can happen is to get sick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s better to lose time looking for a ford than to lose gear crossing a river.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; taught the pressures and priorities of international politics and warfare. What made them so great was that you didn&#39;t have to copy the course of a historical battle or nation. They were a sandbox that set the constraints of the world and then let you discover the rules for yourself and the best way to succeed within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you had other educational &#34;games&#34; like Math Olympics (I really hope my old computer teacher isn&#39;t reading this). In that game, you had to answer math questions and if you did it fast enough, you&#39;d get an animation of your character performing well in an Olympic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn&#39;t really a game. It was just a test that gave a cute reward for doing something academic (tricksy hobbitses!). Not...very...motivating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly (or not so much), that is exactly how we are expected to learn after childhood: by study and test, NOT exploration. Despite the fact that 99% of all useful knowledge comes from discovering the rules yourself through experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we focus on study-and-test so much? Because the costs of messing up are so high, it takes a long time to experiment, and it&#39;s just easier (aka, lazier) to spew out information and hope it sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games take away the risk of failure, they simplify things to focus on specific skills, and they give you instant feedback on whether you&#39;re doing well or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which is exactly what makes games great for learning: they allow for lots of focused practice in a low-penalty environment that provides real feedback.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Let this Mistake Stall Your Growth</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/dont-let-this-mistake-stall-your-growth/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/dont-let-this-mistake-stall-your-growth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid injury at all costs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wise mantra to adopt for any kind of physical training, but it is also good practice for business (don&#39;t lose money) and relationships (always fight fair).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason is that there are some mistakes that cause so much damage they make it impossible to keep growing, training, or communicating.&lt;/strong&gt; They undo what you&#39;ve built or remove the very thing you need to keep moving forward (your physical integrity in training, the cash to run your business, or the respect and trust that underlies a relationship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently suffered a viral infection of my inner ear, which completely threw off my sense of balance. That&#39;s right: 24/7 dizziness, motion sickness, and vertigo. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I stopped a lot of my training during this time because it would have been too easy to hurt myself or others (to say nothing of keeping my lunch down). And even if I had been able to train, I wouldn&#39;t have had the balance to rescue myself from the usual falls and trips that occur during martial arts and parkour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mistakes would have been too costly. Even if I was WILLING to see them as feedback rather than failure, they could easily cause injury that would simply stop my learning process.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Beat Your Biggest Learning Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/beat-biggest-learning-obstacle/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/beat-biggest-learning-obstacle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In weightlifting, we always remind people not to let their ego get in the way of training. A lot of people come to training with a mindset of competing with the barbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bad idea. The barbell has no ego, no mind, no concern for &#34;winning&#34; or &#34;losing.&#34; It&#39;s just heavy. It simply tells you how strong you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not how strong you should be, or how strong you were. It tells you exactly how strong you ARE, today, regardless of your self-expectations or &#34;shoulds.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approach the bar with a willingness to learn and an acceptance of the reality that you aren&#39;t &#34;already a master&#34; and it will teach you and make you stronger. On the other hand, hold the belief that you should already be good at this, and you will move about as fast as your fully loaded barbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bet you never thought of weightlifting as philosophical, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Ego takes Mistakes Personally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with bringing an ego to learning is that it tends to take mistakes personally: &#34;If I make a mistake, it means I, personally, screwed up. And that means I AM a screw up!&#34;</description>

      <title>What Great Leaders and Awesome Teachers Have in Common</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/what-great-leaders-and-awesome-teachers-have-in-common/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/what-great-leaders-and-awesome-teachers-have-in-common/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A band of alien misfits sits in a circle, about to enter the biggest battle of their lives, which they expect to be a suicide mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are at each others&#39; throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the pep talk scene in &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, &lt;/em&gt;just before Star Lord, the unofficial leader, steps up and inspires everyone to work together, even to walk into certain death, and support one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems almost unrealistic--just a convenient outcome to move the plot along--but he uses a technique that is actually a core element of effective leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, it&#39;s used by great teachers in classrooms all over the world: connect the task-at-hand with the personal motivations of each individual on the team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You can&#39;t MAKE other people do anything.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s well-known that no matter how much authority and power you have, ultimately, people only do things because they want to. They might want the money you&#39;re going to give them, or the recognition, but THEY are the ones deciding to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be easy to forget this...unless you&#39;re a teacher.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers know firsthand how vital it is to get a student personally invested in their own academic success. No amount of detentions, low grades, or trips to the principle will convince a student who just isn&#39;t invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have to make them want it for themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great teacher knows how to make academic success relevant to every student. If one student doesn&#39;t care that much about her own success, but is deeply concerned with living up to her parents&#39; expectations, the teacher might remind her, &#34;What would your mom want for you right now?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another student might be powerfully motivated to pursue an athletic career, in which case the teacher might bring in examples of professional athletes whose game benefited from studying hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leader in other contexts has to do the same thing: find out what your team members care about and help them connect it to the group&#39;s mission.</description>

      <title>Why I Love Working with Kids</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Children give you a lot of perspective on life. They are impossible to keep in order, except when you do seemingly trivial and silly things. They seem very rude and uncouth most of the time, but the best way to get them to do what you want is simply to ask nicely. They remind you what&#39;s important in life, and the importance of friends, food, and enough rest. They also teach you how to appreciate the little things in life, like the wonder of floating on a surfboard in the sun (something I find endlessly tedious) and how stupid things can be really, legitimately funny.</description>

      <title>Why Learning is Hard, and How to Make it Easier</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-learning-is-hard-and-how-to-make-it-easier/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-learning-is-hard-and-how-to-make-it-easier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if simply reading about something, or even reading how to do it, could make us learn it. But the reality is that actually learning a skill or concept well enough to apply it is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As kids, we tend to learn really fast. I&#39;ve worked with kids from kindergarten all the way up to high school, and the biggest change that I see is that the older a kid gets, the more they try to avoid making mistakes. They take fewer risks, become less active, and generally work hard to save face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Younger kids on the other hand, are usually much more willing to try things, answer questions they don&#39;t know, and get their hands dirty. They don&#39;t (usually) mind looking like newbies, and this willingness to make mistakes empowers them to learn quickly.</description>

      <description>The story of the titan Atlas is traditionally one of oppression. As punishment for his defiance of the Olympian gods, Atlas is imprisoned by Zeus, condemned to carry the sky on his shoulders for all eternity. He gets a brief respite when he convinces Heracles to carry the load, but is quickly tricked back into his chains. And so he stands, crushed by the weight of the sky, for all of his immortal life.</description>

      <title>How to Find Mentors</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-find-mentors/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-find-mentors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3950&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mentor-e1424929492734.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mentor&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;303&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an individual, you can accomplish a lot, but no matter what, you will always be limited by your available time and experience. Being able to learn from other people&#39;s experiences, wisdom, and skills is the key to fast-tracking your growth and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentors who have gathered around me have been so valuable in helping me move forward, take initiative, and untangle the many complex problems I&#39;ve faced starting businesses and creating positive change in my community. But I&#39;m not the only person for whom mentors have been important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you probably know I&#39;m a history buff, and one of my favorite kinds of books to read is biography. This summer, I read &lt;em&gt;Titan, &lt;/em&gt;the biography of J. D. Rockefeller, this fall I read &lt;em&gt;Jobs,&lt;/em&gt; and I&#39;m currently about halfway through &lt;i&gt;The Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all massively influential people who had far-reaching impact not only on their own times, but on future generations as well. And, even if they wouldn&#39;t admit it (Steve Jobs, maybe), they all had great mentors. Rockefeller and Carnegie gushed about the generosity of their mentors, and Carnegie in particular spoke of his early employer as the ideal of businessmen. The men who helped Rockefeller and Carnegie take their first steps in their careers were remembered fondly by both men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentors matter. They provide guidance when you are trying to figure out how to solve a problem. They provide motivation when you have to check in. They provide connections to their own networks as you are beginning to grow. They provide opportunity, often simply by giving you a place or a job to gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get someone else to contribute a little bit of their hard-won experience to your own enthusiastic but naive efforts, you will leapfrog past many of the obstacles that slow others down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, mentors are vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you go about surrounding yourself with a network of supportive people have both the desire and the ability to help you succeed?</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;I&#39;m the one chance you&#39;ve got of staying alive.&#34; - Clara Oswald, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, Season 8, &lt;em&gt;Flatline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&#39;ve run into this problem: You want to make a difference in the world by inspiring, motivating, and supporting the people around you, but you aren&#39;t in charge. You don&#39;t feel like anyone is paying attention to your ideas or giving you permission to start a new project that might take the business in a new direction, or even start a new company that would change the face of the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you just keep on working at whatever you do, coloring in the lines, and dreaming about the day you get to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult place to be because you have great ideas and strong convictions, but you are afraid that if you take action on them, you will upset people. You aren&#39;t sure if they are happy where they are, and even if they aren&#39;t, change is always scary. You don&#39;t want to be the one to bring that on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, while change is scary, it is also inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might as well be the one to direct it and help people grow with it, rather than resist and stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you get over the leadership hump to get others on board and make a difference?</description>

      <title>The Everyday Hero</title>

      <description>What does heroism mean to you?
For some people, heroism is about showing up for their families. Maybe you make a comfortable income, but getting home late and never having the chance to tuck your kids into bed makes you feel empty and hollow.
For others, it&#39;s the other way around: you take care of the home and family, but you want to have a bigger impact in the wider community.</description>

      <title>Non-Productive Actions that Make You Powerfully Effective</title>

      <description>I learn a lot from my mornings. They usually set the tone for my day.
For example, last week, I missed my morning run and meditation most days. On the weekend, today and yesterday, I managed to make those both happen. The difference was pretty noticeable.
Sometimes, I have to make a choice between getting work done and going out for my run. My first instinct is to do the work, but that&#39;s actually not as significant an investment in my performance and my day as running.</description>

      <title>How to Take On Big Projects Without Choking</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-swallow-big-goals-without-choking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3930&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smallfishbiggoal-e1423078046392.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallfishbiggoal&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; /&gt;I woke up this morning and looked out on a winter wonderland. Snow had been coming down all night, and it was falling in tiny biting crystals that stuck to everything. Very pretty, very cold, and very wet. The sidewalks were covered in snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;I guess I&#39;m not going for my morning run,&#34; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I stopped myself and asked a different question: &#34;&lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; I go for my morning run, in shorts and a shirt as usual?&#34; I&#39;d run in cold weather before, but not in actual falling snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn&#39;t know the answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided not to make assumptions about my limitations and just give it a shot. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad.</description>

      <title>How a Pair of Jeans Taught Me to Be Myself</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-a-pair-of-jeans-taught-me-to-be-myself/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3923&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Jeans-e1422508471220.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jeans&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;246&#34; /&gt;One day, I needed new pants. The jeans I&#39;d been wearing were so torn up I was ashamed to wear them. I went to Macy&#39;s and bought the jeans I thought I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; own: Levi&#39;s 501s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so enamored of the label that I didn&#39;t even consider other options, determined to fit into this arbitrary definition of &#39;cool&#39; even if it felt miserable, which it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have weird proportions. I&#39;m tall and lanky with a narrow waist, which is difficult enough (try finding 31x34 pants anywhere). Add to that the fact that my thighs and glutes are big for my size thanks to weightlifting and I&#39;m impossible to fit. I felt like the Tin Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I stubbornly biked around in my Real Jeans, feeling good about my authentic denim and that little red tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the hip pain started and I had to admit that I couldn&#39;t sacrifice my comfort to fit into a pair of pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one pair of pants I&#39;ve owned that actually felt and looked really good. They were prAna jeans, which I could get from a local store. They were expensive, had spandex in them, and were so self-consciously stylish, there was no way I could wear them, but I decided to try them on anyway.</description>

      <title>The Adventure Next Door</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-adventure-next-door/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-adventure-next-door/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3917&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mundane-e1422321898327.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mundane&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;321&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently visited the Hemingway House in Key West, where I got to see glimpses of the life of a very interesting man. He lived during a period full of historically significant events, but walking through his house, I could imagine the years crawling quietly by, much as they seem to in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemingway, however, didn&#39;t just hang out at home. His walls were full of photos of places he&#39;d been and things he&#39;d done, artifacts from his travels, and all the indicators of a life well-spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the average person in 1940, when Hemingway published &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&lt;/em&gt; thought it was a fairly mundane time. There was a world war going on, sure, but we in America have essentially been at war since 2001, and in 1940, mainland America had never been directly threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, 1940 seems like a romantic era full of heroes and drama, but in reality, it was the individuals, like Hemingway, who brought the heroism and drama to the times. I imagine he would have thought our time was full to the brim with adventure.</description>

      <title>What You Believe Could Kill You</title>

      <description>I came across a study recently looking at the relationship between stress and health. The study uncovered a relationship between high levels of stress and premature death, but only when those suffering the high stress also believed that stress was bad for them.
What I thought interesting is that the group that didn&#39;t believe stress was negative still experienced the same amount of stress. They just didn&#39;t die from it.</description>

      <title>A 10 Minute Exercise that Will Change Your Day</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-10-minute-exercise-that-will-change-your-day/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-10-minute-exercise-that-will-change-your-day/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3907&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/watch-e1421889550877.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;watch&#34; width=&#34;698&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;Imagine what your life would be like and what you&#39;d accomplish if you started &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day full of passion, purpose and drive. Not just a few days a month, or a few hours of each day, but every hour of every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re probably thinking that&#39;d be great, but it&#39;s not realistic. After all, moods and mindsets are fickle, and people are either born with drive or they&#39;re not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself asking the same question recently, and I decided to see if I could find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my research on high achieving individuals, from the ultra-wealthy to the ultra-accomplished, I noticed that the biggest difference was their mindset. They ask different kinds of questions and see the world in a different way than the majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For an example of this, check out &lt;a title=&#34;KhanAcademy Interviews Elon Musk&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwzmJpI4io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sal Khan&#39;s interview of Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me that an essential technique for increasing people&#39;s capabilities was to find a way for them to consistently elevate their mindset. Each day spent in a state of openness to possibility compounds on the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, for most of us, our mindset is determined by our mood, which is often determined by the events of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to make sure that every day started with an empowered mindset.</description>

      <description>What a discouraging headline for a blog post, right? Stick with me though, I promise you&#39;ll have something interesting to think about.
When I was transforming my fitness and my body, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing. I cringe remembering all the things I did wrong and all the ways I could have hurt myself.
But I also remember how determined I was. I was willing to do anything and everything necessary to accomplish my goals.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m...a guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down. - Psy, Gangnam Style
 I recently began running in the snow wearing only a t-shirt, light pants, and my minimalist shoes. Air temperatures here in Boulder have been 34 degrees at the warmest, and down around 23 this morning.
Every morning, I look wistfully at my warm hoodie and gloves as I pull on my thin shirt and head out the door.</description>

      <description>Alright! It&#39;s the end of the second week in January and we&#39;re finally done with all the ways to plan out an epic 2015. Part 1 focused on the big picture strategy. Part 2 focused on the foundational habits that need to happen to provide the time, energy, and financial resources to make it happen. Part 3 will focus on the specific actions to take.

      <title>My 2015 Strategy Part 2: The Logistics of Being Awesome</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/my-2015-strategy-part-2-the-logistics-of-being-awesome/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3880&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/timeclock-e1420568994227.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;timeclock&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; /&gt;Last week, I shared &lt;a title=&#34;My 2015 Strategy Part 1: Dreams and Aspirations&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/my-2015-strategy-part-1-dreams-and-aspirations/&#34;&gt;my overarching strategy for 2015&lt;/a&gt; and how I got there, with a simple, but very helpful exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I was planning to talk about specific actions and the structures I&#39;m going to put into place to support my plans, but it became a longer article than I&#39;d expected. So, I&#39;m going to limit it to logistics now, and actions on Thursday, because dreams without action will stay that way, and action without logistics will fizzle out real fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize not everyone here is a military history buff (or UPS admirer), so you may not be entirely familiar with what logistics are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, logistics are the support systems that enable an army to do its job. This includes things like food, transportation systems, and even lifestyle. The best trained Navy SEAL is useless without the entire support system that puts him in the right place to start his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your personal life, it is important to create a system to support you. This includes things like your habits, your environment, and your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good logistics are just as essential as good strategy and good tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with last week&#39;s post was that I didn&#39;t account for time, energy, or financial resources; I simply wrote down everything I want to do in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this week, I&#39;ll show you how to handle the rest.</description>

      <title>My 2015 Strategy Part 1: Dreams and Aspirations</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/my-2015-strategy-part-1-dreams-and-aspirations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3875&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/newyear-e1420164792163.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;newyear&#34; width=&#34;698&#34; height=&#34;280&#34; /&gt;At the end of 2014, I sat down and wrote down all the things I would do if time and money were no issue. It&#39;s a really helpful exercise in figuring out what your mission in life is and where you find fulfillment, one I&#39;ll share in the Exercise section in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought, &#34;Okay, so I&#39;ll have a list of things that I can start thinking about doing, SOMEDAY.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turned out that most of the things I wanted to do didn&#39;t require time or money at all. Here&#39;s what I ended up writing, abridged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;I would write a genre-bending science-fiction novel....I would travel to Tibet, hike the Himalayas, have tea with the Dalai Lama, and encounter a snow leopard in the wild...I would become a valuable resource for all of my friends, providing support, resources, and strategy to help them achieve their goals and dreams...I would travel back to Korea to study with my Krav Maga teacher for an extended sabbatical, and also go to Japan to study with a living ninjutsu master....I would read all the classics...I would find a way to see my friends face-to-face, or at least have more phone conversations, especially with the ones who have stuck with my for years....I would spend more time in nature, camping more than once a year....I would rekindle my love of gaming, playing more RPGs, computer strategy games, and card games with friends....I would get back into flying regularly....Start a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distilled those dreams down into the following list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a novel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Tibet, meet the Dalai Lama, and see a snow leopard in the wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become a martial arts master -- Krav Maga, Kenpo, Ninjutsu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more face-to-face time with friends and become a valuable support to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play more games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more time in nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, the one that resonated the most and seemed the most central to my idea of success and fulfillment was being there for my friends and supporting people. So that is my mission: &lt;strong&gt;to help the people in my life achieve their dreams by showing them how to be heroic in their own lives and communities.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Strategies for Success in 2015</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/strategies-for-success-in-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/strategies-for-success-in-2015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3869&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/chess-e1419979014150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chess&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;406&#34; /&gt;I don&#39;t like resolutions. &lt;a title=&#34;Forget the Resolution! Set a Challenge!&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/forget-the-resolution-set-a-challenge/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Remember 2013&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with resolutions is that they simply set a goal. They don&#39;t provide a way to actually accomplish that goal, and often, they don&#39;t even determine if the goal is worth pursuing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no wonder so many people set resolutions on January 1st only to see them fall apart in a month. &lt;strong&gt;Most resolutions are chosen on a whim, or are the result of compounding pain, not compelling vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not that resolutions themselves are bad, it&#39;s that they are missing the essentials of good growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear mission/purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actionable goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspects of the Warrior Spirit is being dedicated to a cause or a mission. Having that foundation is what gives you the ability to muster superhuman determination in whatever you choose to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...you can&#39;t know what goals matter unless you have a clear idea of your mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first step in creating a strategy for 2015 is to refocus on your mission.</description>

      <title>Happy Holidays from Warrior Spirit, and Looking Back with Gratitude</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/happy-holidays-from-warrior-spirit-and-looking-back-with-gratitude/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you for your continued support in 2014. Every year, I take the opportunity of the holidays to express my gratitude to everyone who has impacted my life in the last twelve months, and since this blog is a big part of my life, you&#39;re one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very rough year for me. After the success of launching my first ebook in 2012 and gaining a big following in 2013, I let my expectations get out of control. I got frustrated and the quality of my writing suffered. I lost focus. I feel like Warrior Spirit has lost a lot of what made it a great blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there were a lot of good things that happened, too. I got engaged, which was a big step for me, reignited my love of games, am taking a chess class (see below), and started work on my novel, which is now almost halfway written. I managed to pay down half of my credit card debt and began working with a money, career, and business coach to take my lofty ambitions and give them some focus. I started an internship, increased my income, and established a regular meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&#39;s been a good year, but the biggest hole has been the spotty posting here. I know (because you&#39;ve told me) that Warrior Spirit provides a lot of value for its readers, and that gives me a lot to work with. So I&#39;ve committed to getting back to twice-a-week postings, which seems to be the sweet spot based on previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Warrior Spirit in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assert that anyone can become a hero in his or her community and life, the kind of person that changes the world for those they care about. I have always wanted to support people in doing that by helping them live up to their greatest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, in 2015, I am making the blog all about that and committing to taking concrete, specific action on helping you achieve your goals, whatever they are, by empowering you to be the best you can be.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Can I do This?: A Question to Improve Performance on Everything</title>

Remind yourself how awesome you are! Tell yourself, &#34;I can do this! I&#39;m a rockstar!&#34; Maybe you&#39;ve even done this, despite all feelings to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever been in an airplane during extreme turbulence, you don&#39;t want to overhear your pilot insisting, &#34;I can do this! Yeah!&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are talking at all, you want to hear specific actions that they will be taking to make things better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a reason for this. Our minds actually interpret insistent statements like these as a sign that there is something really wrong. After all, if you were confident, you wouldn&#39;t even need to bother with the motivation at all, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out there&#39;s a better way to motivate yourself, one that feels less like a desperate plea to convince yourself of something you just don&#39;t believe, and that actually helps you do better, rather than simply feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask the simple question, &#34;Can I do this?&#34;</description>

      <description>Some books change our lives. Daring Greatly was that kind of book for me. In the midst of an internal crisis this summer, I came across this book by Brene Brown, renowned researcher and author on vulnerability, courage, worthiness, and shame.
One of Brown&#39;s key points is that, in order to do great things, we have to embrace vulnerability. That feeling of exposing yourself is scary, but it&#39;s necessary because only by really reaching outside our comfort zones, by risking real pain or loss, can we achieve something really worth striving for.</description>

      <title>The Acorn and the Oak Tree; How to Let Go of Striving so You Can Grow</title>

      <description>Most people don&#39;t think much of acorns, but are very impressed by oak trees. Thus, most people think of an acorn as nothing more than a means to an oak tree. The acorn itself is worthless. All that matters is the tree that comes out of it.
But then we may make the mistake of creating an environment that is ideal for a fully grown oak, not a young acorn.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a reader story from Claire Higgins, a coach, yoga instructor, and martial artist who is sharing her story of returning to the core of her passion for training: Karate itself. It&#39;s a great story illustrating how easy it can be to get pulled off track from doing the things we love in the name of supporting the things we love (like the classic case of a parent working so hard they don&#39;t see their family, justifying it all by saying it&#39;s for the family&#39;s well-being, when in fact, all they want is to spend more time together).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered personal training to get fitter for Karate (it was CrossFit inspired). Soon, I was expected to work out several times a week on top of a demanding Karate schedule, dedicated yoga practice and teaching, and driving 4 hrs a day for my last (very stressful) job. So I built a home gym, complete with an olympic bar that I didn&#39;t use often enough as I was so exhausted. My Karate performance improved a lot but I was so tired I felt miserable at training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal trainer was fabulous but my aim was never to get better at lifting or scoring bigger numbers. It was to swing a faster punch, build more stamina, and develop more explosive speed so that I could get my 2nd dan. My Karate teacher smiled patiently at me, explaining that the heavier weights, hanging, and handstands wouldn&#39;t help there. He recommended lighter weights, faster reps, and working out THROUGH Karate training, not FOR it. But for some reason, I couldn&#39;t yet change my mindset.</description>

      <description>I was recently offered what seemed on the surface like a great job opportunity. It would have solved all my money problems, set me up for a good four or five years, and been a great resume builder.
But I said no.
It was not an easy decision. There&#39;s so much in our culture prioritizing money and career advancement. A solid, steady income often trumps all other concerns, and we usually excuse our friends and family for blowing off commitments because of work.</description>

      <description>What do people really mean when they say, &#34;Be reasonable!&#34;?
&#34;Don&#39;t do anything that will get you noticed. Play nice. Keep quiet. Stay normal, unobtrusive, inoffensive, and as safe and risk-free as possible.&#34;
But unreasonable people, who just ask for what they want, who don&#39;t tamp themselves down to fit in and avoid making waves...we are jealous of them. Why is that?
Because they break all the rules. Because they act freely.</description>

 Oooh, that&#39;s not really true. I had better correct them as soon as I can get a word in. I don&#39;t agree with that. I need to make that clear right now [SCOWLY FACE] I have a brilliant response to that! They will get a kick out of it, so I&#39;ll interrupt to share.</description>

      <description>Don&#39;t you just hate running around all day, schedule packed to the brim, phone buzzing every five minutes? It&#39;s crazy! No human should have to live like that, constantly frazzled.
If you live like that, you probably promise yourself to slow down one day, but you haven&#39;t yet. You actually do choose that life. As my Landmark Forum coach would&#39;ve said, &#34;You love it!&#34;
I know I have uttered the words, &#34;</description>

      <description>Sitting in the ER last night, I wondered where I had gone astray. When did the biggest concern in my world boil down to getting my next paycheck? When did I stop building things? When did my view shrink from four years to four weeks?
When did I start turning away from things that were challenging, instead of reaching for them and reveling in the stretch?
Sitting in the emergency room tends to bring out these sorts of introspective thoughts.</description>

      <description>Warrior Spirit has been a wonderful adventure, but I&#39;m sad to say I have decided to scale it back considerably.
I haven&#39;t really been able to focus it and lately, it has felt more of an obligation and a burden than something I get excited for. Also, my life is undergoing massive changes at the moment, and I feel that Warrior Spirit, as something that was started right after college, is making it difficult for me to let go of my old ways in order to grow, largely because I have several hundred eyes on me as I&#39;m shifting things around.</description>

      <title>The Art of Life and Love</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-art-of-life-and-love/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I took the Landmark Forum. For those of you who don&#39;t know, Landmark is a personal development coaching workshop that has a reputation for being confrontational. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their coaching method, but I certainly did learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that forms the core of the Landmark approach to life is that life is meaningless, and that this fact is itself meaningless (which is kind of a clever solution to the problem, though it becomes contradictory considering the intention behind making the statement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve been on Warrior Spirit for a while, you know that I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working on the idea that life has no inherent meaning. The conclusion I came to, and that which Landmark offered, is that we create the meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is a simplistic answer that fails to capture the true nature of being, a creative, artistic act.</description>

      <title>The Question that Will Set You Free</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;True freedom isn&#39;t doing whatever we feel like. It&#39;s being able to do what we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between doing what we want and doing what we feel like. The former takes discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is stressful. Besides all of the frustrations of making ends meet and getting work done, there never seems to be enough time to do everything you should be doing. Besides work, you&#39;ve got your health, exercise, self-improvement, relationships, education, volunteering, cooking, playing...the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, it can get overwhelming, and it&#39;s so much easier to just turn on the autopilot and let things drag you along without thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever find yourself doing any of the following?</description>

      <title>The Nature of Fear: Part 2: Tactics to Quell Fear</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-nature-of-fear-part-2-tactics-to-quell-fear/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-nature-of-fear-part-2-tactics-to-quell-fear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I must not fear.&lt;br /&gt;
Fear is the mind-killer.&lt;br /&gt;
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.&lt;br /&gt;
I will face my fear.&lt;br /&gt;
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.&lt;br /&gt;
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.&lt;br /&gt;
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
Only I will remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, Frank Herbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Nature of Fear: Part 1, Fear is a Choice&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-nature-of-fear-part-1-fear-is-a-choice/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here to read part 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my first night alone in the woods, I had learned that fear is a choice. It came from the fact that I often saw myself as a victim, someone who was generally vulnerable to others&#39; whims and the world&#39;s catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking, &#34;Of course you were vulnerable! You were alone, asleep, in the forest! If something had happened, there would have been no way to get help.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I&#39;m much more vulnerable on a highway, where the chance of injury in a way I cannot respond to is much higher. I &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; myself as vulnerable in the woods, but it&#39;s not a fact of the situation. A tiger doesn&#39;t feel threatened alone in a forest. It is the thing that makes others feel threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, the first step to overcoming the fear of sleeping alone in the woods was realizing that my fear was the result of how I chose to view myself and the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That enabled me to question it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, and the project for the second night, was actually learning to quell fear. As the sun set for the second time on my trip, I wasn&#39;t any less afraid than I had been the night before, but I was more confident in my ability to handle the anxiety that might come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I saw the signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the privy were three scrawled notes, memorials to those who had passed away in the last year. Those three letters--R.I.P.--have a lot of power to set an overactive imagination in a particular direction. I imagined that my campsite was the lurking place of a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I lay in my tent that night, I came up with a few strategies to deal with the new terror.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Fear: Part 1, Fear is a Choice</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-nature-of-fear-part-1-fear-is-a-choice/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-nature-of-fear-part-1-fear-is-a-choice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I stepped onto the trail, I gave one last look back at my car, parked by itself in a clearing off the road in upstate Connecticut. I could turn back now. I didn&#39;t have to go out there into the woods. Two hours of driving and I&#39;d been back in my house, surrounded by people and light switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned and headed into the forest. The sun was high, but it would soon begin its long descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A History of Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear has been a constant companion in my life. When I was very young, I discovered that the night is full of terror. There were ghosts in my closet, monsters under my bed, aliens in the air ducts, and unnameable things down the stairs. I had complex and confusing bedtime rituals to deal with all these dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I realized that I would one day die, and my nights took on a whole new form of terror. Sleep seemed like one step away from the eternal unconsciousness of death. I suffered panic attacks thinking about it, and the fear of being alone at night when one of these attacks happened was enough to keep me from sleeping well most of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there were the night terrors, waking dreams of unseeable presences in my room and the urgent need to jump up, despite being apparently paralyzed (psychologists speculate that this form of nightmare is the origin of alien abduction and possession experiences. I&#39;m inclined to agree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things got worse in the wilderness. Even sleeping next to my father in a tent, I would lie awake and paralyzed with fear, waiting for anything from a bear to the reanimated corpse of the Camel Woman to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fears didn&#39;t subside much as I got older. Even as recently as a few months ago, after an episode of &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, I woke up in my bed with dead certainty that there was a stone angel lurking in the living room...only to find myself totally paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything and everything my mind could use to scare itself, it has hoarded and nurtured, bringing to life at the most sinister moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting a New Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage, and confidence in the doing.” - Anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was becoming a serious problem, affecting my sleep and my self-confidence; &lt;strong&gt;it&#39;s very hard to imagine changing the world when you are afraid of the dark&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I decided to put myself to the test: I would spend three nights alone in the woods.&lt;/strong&gt; I would either learn to control my mind, to see the world for what it is rather than a stage for my personal terror, or I would spend three miserable nights in a near-panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the second option wasn&#39;t really a great alternative.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The greatest gift you can give someone is your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything else follows from that. Being present is the key to developing an irresistible presence, but staying totally engaged is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shortcut--you have to build that mental muscle through directed practice and commit to using it--but there are some things you can do to make it a little easier.</description>

      <title>The Magical Power of Attention, Your Most Valuable Asset</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-magical-power-of-attention-your-most-valuable-asset/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-magical-power-of-attention-your-most-valuable-asset/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us don&#39;t realize how powerful and valuable our attention is. As a result, we let it leak away and rarely bother to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so powerful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you put your attention on grows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferriss made this point in The 4-Hour Body when he showed that simply tracking your weight daily, without even attempting to make changes, led to consistent weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not necessarily saying there is some magical energy created by humans concentrating on specific things. It probably has to do with small micro-behaviors that start to accumulate when we have something in the forefront of our mind. Maybe constantly thinking about your weight leads your brain to subtly adjust weight-loss metabolic processes or change your appetite in small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe humans are magical.</description>

      <title>If You Don&#39;t Show Up, Life Won&#39;t Either</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Work is love made visible. - Khalil Gibran&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have run into two conflicting theories on how success works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get lucky. Opportunities come along or they don&#39;t. You have to be in the right place at the right time or you just won&#39;t get very far. Some people have it, and some people don&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success is entirely dependent on your willingness to put in hard work and dedicate yourself to accomplishing what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lean on the first explanation usually don&#39;t see themselves as very abundant or successful. They feel a lot of frustration around their lives and their dreams, and so they claim that it&#39;s all luck to shirk responsibility for what they see as failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who has done really well, but he gives off a constant anxiety about losing it all. He uses the &#34;I got lucky&#34; argument in a way that absolves him of responsibility for his success, but my guess is he also doesn&#39;t want to think it would be his fault if things don&#39;t turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other option is a more empowering viewpoint, but it is also often used to offer excuses. For example, insisting your success is based purely on your hard work might give you permission to ignore others&#39; needs and the realities of the world (market demands, consumer interests, quality of your services, importance of outside help and connections, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, of course there&#39;s a balance.</description>

      <title>Want to Be Irresistable? Be Authentic</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/want-to-grab-someones-attention-be-authentic/</link>

      <description>The email exercise that went out last week was on the idea of developing your unique presence, that intangible quality that makes someone irresistible and inspiring.
The question ultimately comes down to whether you are engaged in the moment--are you present?--or whether you spend most of your time in your head, worrying, speculating, and second-guessing yourself.
If you do the latter, you can experience life fully and live in HD. You hold the key to happiness.</description>

      <title>Life is Not a Dare. Don&#39;t Make it One</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/life-is-not-a-dare-dont-make-it-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/life-is-not-a-dare-dont-make-it-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just because a challenge exists doesn&#39;t mean we have to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoah there! That doesn&#39;t sound like the indomitable Warrior Spirit, you might be thinking. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was training CrossFit, I remember putting off the training I wanted to be doing (gymnastics, martial arts, parkour, hiking and climbing) for the training I had been convinced was more hardcore/intense/effective/respectable. I was trying to win someone else&#39;s game for a prize I didn&#39;t even care about, just because it was a challenge issued in a way that got my attention and I have a demon about always being the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my quest to be great at fitness, I adopted CrossFit&#39;s standards and tried to master them, even though the end goal wasn&#39;t what I wanted. I kept telling myself that I would get around to the stuff I really cared about...once I finished this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, this approach to fitness was just one symptom of a deeper tendency to take everything as a challenge. Someone driving an expensive car was a dare to do better. Some guy walking down the street better dressed than I was a challenge. It was toxic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to live in the best city (which was always somewhere I was not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to have the best girlfriend, which varied between hot, pretty, smart, independent, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to do the most important, best paying job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to be the best looking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to be the most spiritual, and the most patient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to make the most money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these &#39;bests&#39; were things other people defined, or society in general defined. What made me happy and the &#39;best&#39; were not the same thing. And when I would occasionally attain &#39;the best,&#39; it was only a matter of time before someone else or some other segment of society would issue a new dare, and I&#39;d be dissatisfied again.</description>

      <title>The Pains of Transitions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry I&#39;ve been MIA for the last few weeks. A rushed departure from Boulder meant that I wasn&#39;t able to write anything. But 30+ hours on the road is lots of time for thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has changed in a big way, and I don&#39;t yet know what will emerge on the other side of this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Breaking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been filled with all sorts of traumas, some big and some small, the hallmark of transition. That, too, is normal. Joseph Campbell pointed out that the hero&#39;s journey always requires some kind of death and rebirth. No matter the promised rewards, the death is always terrifying. The hero is faced with obliteration in order to become someone stronger.</description>

      <description>“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.”- Joseph Campbell
 We spend so much time worrying about the future or reliving the past that we rarely if ever experience the present.</description>

      <description>“It&#39;s not so much how busy you are, but why you are busy. The bee is praised. The mosquito is swatted.” - Mary O&#39;Connor
 There is no real connection between work done and productivity. Some of the most productive things people do, which bring the most joy, money, insight, efficiency, or whatever, take very little time and effort.
And some of the most useless things take all day to do.</description>

      <title>Two Ways to Play the Game of Life</title>

      <description>&#34;Now we&#39;re going to do front flips from high up.&#34; My coach pointed at three platforms and the crash mat below them. &#34;You can do either the 2 foot, the 4 foot, or the 6 foot, whichever you&#39;re comfortable with.&#34;
We all went for the 4 foot platform. It wasn&#39;t so high and scary as the 6 foot, but it was bigger than the 2 foot so we felt like we were pushing ourselves a bit.</description>

      <title>How to Grow Your Most Valuable Asset</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-grow-your-most-valuable-asset/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-grow-your-most-valuable-asset/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An asset is a resource that can create value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formal definition by the International Accounting Standards Board is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Kiyosaki, the author of&lt;em&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&lt;/em&gt;, defines an asset is something that puts money in your pocket, like an investment or the royalties you get on your book, or even the time you spend working at your job (which provides a 1-to-1 exchange of value).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#39;s you&#39;re greatest asset? What is the one thing you have that can create an infinite amount of value in the world, both tangible and intangible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your mind&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <description>As long as you truly respect the other person, you can say whatever you want without hurting them. - A friend
 It&#39;s not a compliment, being called a nice guy. &#34;Nice guys finish last&#34; means that being nice is giving up ambition and assertiveness.
Or maybe you&#39;ve heard, &#34;No more Mr. Nice Guy,&#34; meaning, &#34;I&#39;m done holding back my true abilities,&#34; or, &#34;Now I&#39;m going to say what I mean.</description>

      <title>The Most Important Skill You&#39;ll Ever Learn</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-most-important-skill-youll-ever-learn/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Go eagerly where the fear is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are at a party. Across the snack table, you notice a small crowd gathering around an underdressed guy in jeans and a t-shirt. He turns out to be a well-known science-fiction book agent. Just the person you are looking to meet since finishing your novel. You want to talk to that person. But he looks busy, probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate &lt;em&gt;another &lt;/em&gt;awestruck peon, and you wouldn&#39;t get much talk time anyway. You are convinced it would be a waste of time. So you decide to ask the host for his e-mail address on your way out and write later. You have very good reasons not to introduce yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then...as you turn back to the friends you came with, you wonder, why are you even making reasons? You aren&#39;t making that effort for anyone else in the room. Just this one guy who it would be a great idea &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s when you know: if you leave this party without introducing yourself, you will leave defeated. You will have found exactly the thing that you need to do to move forward, and shied away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The things you need to do to move forward are always the things you fear doing.</description>

      <title>Sheep, Wolves, and Sheepdogs</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/sheep-wolves-and-sheepdogs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the young shepherd lay asleep in the sun, his flock grazed peacefully on the lush slopes of the valley, nibbling on clover, alfalfa, and fescue. Their round bodies dotted the mountainside like so many clouds, merging and parting like the real things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without warning, two young wolves burst out of the forest and loped towards the flock. Sheep started bleating in panic and colliding in their panic to escape. The wolves drove right to its center, hoping to scatter it so they could pick off one or two stragglers who got caught in the open, but when the sheep parted, the hunters stopped dead. Waiting for them in the space they&#39;d cleared was a beast of a dog. It&#39;s white shaggy coat blended in with the sheep and so it had been guarding the herd from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheepdog rose to its feet and stared at the wolves. Though it was big, it was still only a dog, and these wolves were wild and dangerous. Muzzles wrinkled back in growls, the three sized each other up. Two to one was not good odds, but the sheepdog did not back away. The wolves, realizing their advantage, stepped forward, heads held low to the ground, long yellow teeth bared. Still the sheepdog did not move but only raised its hackles.</description>

      <title>Why Lifestyle Design is Broken</title>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-lifestyle-design-is-broken/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; was first released, I was so excited to read about quick, easily applied shortcuts to &#39;improve&#39; my life and my body. How could I resist the promise of becoming superhuman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I tried to apply the habits, none of them stuck. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t work, but they were hacks, not part of a cohesive lifestyle, and hacks are not meant to be permanent or sustainable. The &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; in particular reads like a recipe book: you pick your abilities, like building a character in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Lifehacking applied to people, and while the allure was irresistible, it felt hollow.</description>

      <title>3 Life-Changing Lessons from Meditating Daily</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/3-life-changing-lessons-from-meditating-daily/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/3-life-changing-lessons-from-meditating-daily/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Meditation is such a simple act--you just sit in one place and concentrate on your breathing--yet it is also extremely difficult. It can teach you so much about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Over the years, I’ve gone through periods when I meditated regularly and times when I just couldn’t bring myself to sit on the cushion. Even when I was meditating, I’ve gone through periods when I was the easiest thing in the world, and I just couldn’t wait to sit. Other times, I would put it off as long as possible, then drag myself to the cushion, and every second felt like an unbearable eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Through all that, I’ve learned a lot of really powerful lessons from sitting and breathing. Three of them have helped me in many other areas of life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My feelings don’t define me or my world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discomfort isn&#39;t always bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routine matters</description>

      <title>Fight: Learn Confidence through Combative Play</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/fight-learn-confidence-through-combative-play/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/fight-learn-confidence-through-combative-play/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I’ve been experimenting with a new approach to fitness and movement, inspired by a teacher I greatly respect: &lt;a title=&#34;Evolve Move Play&#34; href=&#34;http://www.evolvemoveplay.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rafe Kelley of &lt;em&gt;Evolve Move Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;His philosophy is that humans evolved movement rehearsal (aka, play) to learn and refine the skills we needed to survive. Some of these were simply moving about the environment, but for men especially, the ultimate goal was hunting or fighting other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Removing this context from training robs it of some of its most valuable aspects. Competition encourages growth, whether that is with a training partner or an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Respecting Your Opponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;As a kid, I was unstoppable in contests where there were no losers: straight A&#39;s and every academic award I qualified for. But on a sports field, I preferred playing defense to scoring goals. My contribution to winning was keeping my side from losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When I started &lt;a title=&#34;Returning to the Dojo: The Importance of Martial Arts&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/returning-to-the-dojo-the-importance-of-martial-arts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt;, it was exciting but also uncomfortable because I had to become more assertive. After getting beaten a few times, I learned to &lt;a title=&#34;Learn to Stand Alone&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/learn-to-stand-alone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stand my ground&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&#39;t get violent, but I stopped inviting others to walk all over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play is the perfect place to teach people how to safely assert themselves without hurting others, both physically and emotionally, so that when it becomes important in life, they don’t go overboard.</description>

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I ran into that problem a lot, and I assumed they were making up excuses. After all, words have specific meanings, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;There is one thing that will destroy a person faster than anything else: inauthenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being devoted to a life that you do not have, instead of being present and engaged in the one that you do have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly putting off, day after day, the things you love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never disagreeing for fear of offending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing what you think you should. Being a ‘nice guy’ or a ‘good girl’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living up to others expectations of you, instead of living up to your own standards for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The reason being inauthentic is so self-destructive is because it sends the message to yourself that your beliefs and principles aren&#39;t worth expressing, and therefore you aren&#39;t valuable or worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By presenting ourselves in a way that matches our values, however, we are telling ourselves and others that we think we are worthwhile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;So, by simply doing the things we enjoy, saying the things we hold as true, and acting or presenting ourselves in the ways that reflect who we are, we can build our confidence and sense of purpose.</description>

      <description>Chi Ku (Eat Bitter) -Chinese proverb, meaning, &#34;to endure hardship to attain a goal&#34;
 I have been in Boulder almost a full year now, and it hasn&#39;t been easy.
I came here thinking it was meant to be. I would show up, tell people that I taught natural movement, and BAM, the money would start rolling in. I would be surrounded by nature and like-minded people, be in the midst of deepening my understanding of ecopsychology, and helping others connect with nature and their bodies.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself.” -Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&#39;s eternal question: Do you gain self-respect when your worth is proven in the world, or do you prove your worth by cultivating honest self-respect? And can you fake it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve noticed a harmful trend in personal development literature, in every field from entrepreneurship to dating, recommending over-the-top confidence, arrogance, and sometimes outright lying. In an attempt to get shy quiet types like me to actually sell ourselves, these gurus assure us that pushy sales tactics are a perfectly legitimate way to interact with people. We need to get over our sqeamishness and man-up, whether it&#39;s bulldozing a client to close a deal or asserting dominance to &#39;pick up&#39; a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I disagree. I think that kind of arrogance is symptomatic of people who lack real confidence and so have to rely on a facade of bravado.&lt;/strong&gt; There is certainly value in rehearsal, routines, and templates, but these should serve as a framework to human interaction, not the basis of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Built-in BS Detector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t think anyone can tell the difference? The human brain is really good at making judgement about other people based on subtle body language clues that give away a person&#39;s true character. For example, after watching a 30 second silent clip of a teacher interacting with a student, research subjects were able to predict how well the teacher would do on their evaluation at the end of the semester. Similar results were found with political candidates (2 seconds of exposure) and doctors facing malpractice suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, we&#39;re really good at telling when people are inauthentic. (Whether we give credence to what we detect and actually act on our instinct is a matter of &lt;a title=&#34;Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/&#34;&gt;trusting your intuition&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fake It &#39;til You Make It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&#39;ve also noticed that people tend to assume you have an accurate idea of your own value. That is, if you act like you&#39;re &#34;kind of a big deal,&#34; they&#39;ll treat you that way unless circumstances prove otherwise (they may still challenge or test you to check if you&#39;re bluffing, so don&#39;t actually lie). &lt;strong&gt;If you act like you&#39;re not capable or worthy of respect and responsibility, others will treat you accordingly, even if you&#39;re actual accomplishments suggest otherwise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are you a Consumer or a Creator?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/are-you-a-consumer-or-a-creator/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/are-you-a-consumer-or-a-creator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you imagine yourself living up to your potential, following your bliss, do you envision yourself consuming or creating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Warrior Spirit readers, the answer is usually about creation, about self-expression and self-realization, not about buying into someone else&#39;s idea of what it means to be successful or happy or accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;The Definition of a Consumer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who primarily interacts with the world by using, eating, reading, or buying things created by others is a consumer. We are all consumers to a certain extent: life must consume resources in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our world, consumption has taken on a much more central role. It runs our economy, which is built around making things for others to consume, and which relies on us to spend constantly. Consumption has been elevated to something sacred. The American dream is  having the ability to consume whatever one wants, as often as one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardly a recipe for living up to our potential, unless you believe that a human&#39;s greatest potential is to buy a lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that media is also a thing we consume. The internet provides limitless chances to consume TV, books, movies, music, blogs, tweets, and funny cat pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dangers of Consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we consume partly so we can create. Great writers read great books to fertilize their imaginations. Musicians are influenced by those who came before them. As long as consumption supports creation, there&#39;s nothing wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a state of exclusive consumption has powerfully negative effects. Our environment demonstrates clearly how dangerous overconsumption is on a societal scale, but what happens to a person who primarily views the world through the lens of consumption, who thinks of themselves mainly as someone who buys and eats, shops and watches, reads and listens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine how disempowering it must (does) feel to believe that you are not meant to create things, but only to consume them. You can&#39;t even create and shape the environment you need to thrive and be happy. Instead, the best you can hope for is to purchase the pieces of a good lifestyle defined by somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scary, isn&#39;t it?</description>

      <title>A Millennial Manifesto: The Responsibility to be Great</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-millennial-manifesto-the-passion-of-a-new-generation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-millennial-manifesto-the-passion-of-a-new-generation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are the Millennials. Constantly connected, over-educated, and fired with passion, we have been accused of laziness, entitlement, and narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are to inherit the world, a world that is more and more defined by change: entire business platforms rise and fall in the course of a few months. I have no doubt that history repeats itself, but with over 7 billion people, nations with the power to manufacture unfathomable quantities of goods, and an information network that rivals the human brain, I feel justified in saying &lt;strong&gt;the world we inherit will be unique in human history&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Brave New World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the negative adjectives thrown our way, one thing I have seen among my peers is a truly inspiring degree of passion, a desire to remake the world, to set their own rules and live by their own principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a powerful vision of a world far different than the one we were born into. Many of us have become distrustful of established power structures. We have seen the green revolution co-opted by corporate interests. Growing up in a globalized world has revealed to us that we cannot blindly pursue power without thought for the repercussions on the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything is vulnerable to questioning now&lt;/strong&gt;, and so many of my friends are unsatisfied with what life has given them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lets be honest, life hasn&#39;t give them much. Youth unemployment in the US ranges from 20%-30% (depending on the study and the criteria), an abysmally high number. We are underemployed, not unemployable. We came of age into a world that didn&#39;t have a place for us, that couldn&#39;t utilize us, that expects us to wait idly on the sidelines and be grateful for placeholders like internships and volunteerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, right there, that&#39;s the sense of entitlement we&#39;re accused of. But shall we instead deign to accept meager returns? &lt;strong&gt;I think it&#39;s better to constantly be chafing at the bit, &lt;a title=&#34;Grow to Live: Why Constant Improvement is Necessary&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/grow-to-live-why-constant-improvement-is-necessary/&#34;&gt;striving for more&lt;/a&gt; and the chance to make an impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, Warrior Spirit is a blog for millennials: it admits a sense of higher purpose, the right to excellence, and even the &lt;a title=&#34;Are You in the 1%? You Should Be&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/&#34;&gt;responsibility to be great&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, it asserts the importance of getting your hands dirty, doing the nitty-gritty, and having the pragmatic know-how to make our vision of the world a reality.</description>

      <title>Do You Trade Happiness to Live &#39;Right?&#39;: Claim Your Light</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/do-you-trade-happiness-to-live-right-claim-your-light/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/do-you-trade-happiness-to-live-right-claim-your-light/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. - Marianne Williamson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I moved to Boulder was the belief that it would be a good place to live car-free, to find affordable and plentiful local food, to swear off modern, wasteful comforts (like shoes), and to pursue minimalism by selling my iPad and other non-essentials. Basically, to live the way I believed was Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be much harder that I thought. I never found the spiritual and emotional fulfillment promised. Instead, I was limited in my activities because I could only go so far without a car, I was always hungry because of my insistence on absurdly high food quality, and I was dirty and ratty because my clothes were so worn out and overused. I was a burden to my friends, always leaning on them to drive me places I couldn&#39;t bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was doing the right thing, and that if I held on long enough, things would start to work out (if you&#39;ve read my book, you know I did this with eating Paleo, and CrossFit). When they never did, I got really frustrated and started to feel bitterness and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up cleaving so strongly to the way I believed I &#39;should&#39; be that I completely lost sight of what actually made me happy and ended up undermining my self-esteem and sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I knew a lot of people who weren&#39;t terribly worried about doing things right. They simply went after the things that made them feel good, made them happy, or seemed interesting. Their standard was, &#34;Does this make me happy?&#34; and not, &#34;Is this the right way?&#34; I put so much effort into figuring out the right way and following it, but I was lost and floundering. &lt;strong&gt;It didn&#39;t seem fair that others could be so seemingly lax in their morals but have the peace-of-mind and sense of purpose that I lacked.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those people who was living the dream while happily skipping through life in time with her own drummer, was my little sister.</description>

      <title>Happy Thanksgiving</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/happy-thanksgiving/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/happy-thanksgiving/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is hugely underestimated as a practice, but theories as diverse as time psychology and Buddhism encourage us to take some time to reflect on all that we have to be grateful for. Since reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Time Paradox&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thetimeparadox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Time Paradox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;I have made a habit of keeping a gratitude journal in order to re-tool how I viewed my past from a childhood of frustration and loneliness to one of self-empowerment and creative insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to show appreciation to the people who help you out. None of us can change the world on our own, so if we are honest with ourselves, we must realize that we owe a lot of our success to others. If we want to continue receiving that support, it&#39;s a good idea to offer thanks to those who gave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I offer my appreciation and gratitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Asking for Help</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/asking-for-help/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/asking-for-help/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One trap that we can fall into is the belief that being excellent means we must never ask for help. After all, if we are heroic, legendary human beings, then we shouldn&#39;t need any help, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the heroes of myth and legend needed help. In fact, in many cases it was their ability to bring people to their cause that allowed them to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are we so reluctant to ask for help? Here are some possible reasons.</description>

      <title>The Last 20%</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-last-20/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-last-20/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What distinguishes the good from the great? At what point do you go from being alright to being amazing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the answer to that question is related to how insistent you are on rising past &#39;good enough&#39; to &#39;awesome.&#39; For most things in life, 80% is good enough to get by, so most people stop at 80%:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You eat right 80% of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are 80% committed to your exercise program, but if something comes up, you&#39;re happy to skip a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are happy getting A- grades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You follow up with potential leads 80% of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You listen with 80% of your attention, 80% of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, that&#39;s fine. For most areas of life, that&#39;s all you need. Trying to be 100% in everything would be exhausting. It would require superhuman powers of discipline, scheduling, and sheer determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you know I&#39;m going to say GO FOR IT!</description>

      <title>The Tender-hearted Warrior</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-tender-hearted-warrior/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-tender-hearted-warrior/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with others.” - Chogyam Trungpa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chogyam Trungpa said one of the defining traits of the spiritual warrior is a raw, vulnerable heart open to both the beautiful and the tragic. The main character in Dan Millman&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior &lt;/em&gt;also learns the importance of allowing himself to open up his heart to both love and grieve when a friend&#39;s house burns down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Warrior Spirit is not characterized by a stony heart and ultimate pragmatism. It includes--even requires--a sensitive heart that can be inspired to action to protect the wonderful things in the world and to oppose the evil ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Spirit has a heart so sensitive, &#34;even if a tiny little mosquito lands on it, you feel touched.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! This seems like a liability for us who commit ourselves to taking on the big challenges in the world and our lives. How can we hope to stand up to the manipulations of those with no moral limitations if we are so affected by our own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;strong&gt;the reason there is such suffering and fear in the world is because we hardened our hearts in order to survive the disappointments and hardships of the world&lt;/strong&gt;. By cutting those things out, we also lost our ability to truly appreciate beauty and wonder and we entered into a cycle of emotional defensiveness: we hide in our comfortable houses that keep out the world, we get to work in protective luxury cars that keep out the noise of the street, we isolate ourselves from the suffering of others so we can pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, but we also never understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand everything is to forgive everything. - Buddha</description>

      <title>Pursue Your Bliss with Integrity</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/pursue-your-bliss-with-integrity/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/pursue-your-bliss-with-integrity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is it that makes it so hard for us to pursue our dreams? Why is it so frustrating to pull together all the elements of our lives in order to move in the direction we so fervently want to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow Your Bliss - Joseph Campbell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Campbell compared the internal psychological journey of our lives with classic myths that have accompanied humans throughout history: from Genesis to Robin Hood, Coyote to Quetzalcoatl, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, the stories that move us all share common themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell believed that these themes were reflections of the stages of human development: if we have the &lt;a title=&#34;5 Ways to Boost Your Courage Right Now!&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/5-ways-to-boost-your-courage-right-now/&#34;&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt; to face up to our psychic dragons and to descend into the dark caves and underworlds of our fears and insecurities, we can face the challenges that allow us to become true heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we lack that courage, then we stagnate, never living up to our potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;This begs the question of what directs our growth. Campbell&#39;s answer would be that it is our dreams, aspirations, and passions, the thing that we were put on this earth to do, that drive us. Follow your bliss unerringly and with commitment, and you will surely become the hero of your myth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the myths, the greatest treasures are kept in the darkest caves, guarded by the most fearsome monsters. &lt;strong&gt;Likewise, attaining our bliss requires us to &lt;a title=&#34;Insecurity, the Root of All Evil&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/&#34;&gt;face our most ingrained fears&lt;/a&gt; and negative habits&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Foundation of Empowered Living</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-foundation-of-empowered-living/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-foundation-of-empowered-living/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first task of the aspiring hero is to train her body. Only when she has learned how to master the external world can she begin the far more difficult task of mastering the internal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Entrepreneurial Benefits of Healthy Living&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-entrepreneurial-benefits-of-healthy-living/&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve talked before about how success-oriented types tend to discount the importance of health&lt;/a&gt;. We tell ourselves that we need to put in as much work as we can, now, when we&#39;re young and resilient. Once we&#39;ve earned our leisure time, we will make up for all the lost sleep, convenient food, drinking, and hours spent hunched in front of a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to ignore just how much this neglect is impacting our ability to do quality work right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to talk about the importance of fitness in particular, and why a &lt;strong&gt;physical practice&lt;/strong&gt; is so essential to mastering yourself and unleashing your true potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training my body, becoming stronger and more coordinated, has had a huge impact on my sense of &lt;a title=&#34;How Moving Well Can Make You Confident and Popular&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/two-reasons-play-is-a-big-deal/&#34;&gt;self-confidence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;Practicing Courage Through Movement&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/practicing-courage-throught-movement/&#34;&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe it is an essential thing for any aspiring Warrior to find peace with his or her body. Your body is not just who you are, but it is also your mode of expression in the world. Learn to cultivate it, to appreciate it, and to &lt;a title=&#34;Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/&#34;&gt;trust it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Training Ground for the Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many epics, myths, and legends, young heroes spend their early training in physical preparation. This isn&#39;t because the physical is more important than the mental and the spiritual, but because it is the most basic realm we must master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a hero expect to overcome the more challenges of ideas, thoughts, principles, motivation, and loyalty if they cannot manage their own bodies and move through the world? &lt;strong&gt;Physical competence is a foundational prerequisite for mental and spiritual competencies.</description>

      <title>Are You in the 1%? You Should Be</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an old story of a Roman, Cincinnatus, who was called upon by the Senate in an emergency. Rome&#39;s army had been trapped in the field, leaving the city vulnerable to an attack, and the government nominated Cincinnatus as dictator, giving him 6 months of absolute power. He defeated the enemy in 16 days and immediately gave up his office to return to his farm, becoming a legend of civic virtue and restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate the word &#39;dictator&#39; with a corrupt, power-hungry leader, and that is certainly what most Roman dictators were. But the lesson here is that the office of dictator, and later of emperor, was sullied by the corrupt men who sought and held it, not by the nature of its duties. There were some dictators of sound principles, and some emperors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I watched the documentary &lt;em&gt;Park Avenue,&lt;/em&gt; which is about the wealth gap in America and the political landscape that has made it so entrenched. I&#39;m not especially politically aware (something I&#39;m working on), so it was shocking to see just how bad things are. The 400 richest Americans control as much wealth as 50% of the country, 150 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&#39;ve thought this was just the way our system worked: campaigning was expensive, so businesses and wealthy individuals took advantage of this to offer contributions in exchange for laws that further entrenched their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&#39;t know was that in 1971, soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote a letter to the US Chamber of Commerce, a call-to-arms to US businesses to take a more active role in shaping policy. This was in response to the sweeping political setbacks that had been experienced by corporations in the 60s and early 70s. They heeded the call, and corporate lobbying began to take on the shape it has today.&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Thus, our current system of government-by-corporation was not the result of a broken system, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;was directly pursued by the corporations themselves in response to a perceived threat to their power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result has been the shrinking of the middle class, a huge growth in the income gap, and a polarization of American society between the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be wealthy in this country is to benefit from corrupt politics and to be a part of a system that oppresses the American people. Or so we have come to believe.</description>

      <title>The World is What You Make It, So Make It Good</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose to be optimistic. It feels better. - His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After class last week, one of my students and I got into a conversation on different approaches to academics. He made an observation that &#39;truly smart people&#39; have a particular way to thinking, clearly separating himself from that category. I asked him why he didn&#39;t include himself in that grouping. He had no answer. He just sort of assumed &#39;geniuses&#39; were everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that belief affected the way that he approached his schoolwork, what sorts of activities he did, or what future he envisioned for himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not believe he was up there with the &#39;smart kids&#39;? He himself said he had a solid GPA and did well in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;One of the key tenets of the Warrior Spirit, something essential to living courageously, is the ability to decide how you see the world and how you react to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The necessity of questioning the default perspective has always been emphasized by all sorts of inspirational leaders from Buddha to Chris Guillebeau. &lt;strong&gt;The point is that you can choose how you see and respond to the world, so you might as well choose an empowering view&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always been shocked at how differently the wealthy view money compared to the rest of society. I was first introduced to this in the book, &lt;em&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad. &lt;/em&gt;The author, Robert Kiyosaki, explains the strange dichotomy between how his working-class father talked about money (or didn&#39;t talk) and how his mentor, a wealthy real-estate owner, did. &lt;strong&gt;It was as if they lived in two different worlds, with different rules for how money operated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This book taught me that perspective matters because it changes how we relate to life, how we act, and even what we think is possible. Choosing an empowering perspective can be the difference between floundering and flourishing.</description>

      <title>How to Face Your Inner Demons to Get Unstuck</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-face-your-inner-demons-to-get-unstuck/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-face-your-inner-demons-to-get-unstuck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Yesterday, I brought up the reality that we all have &lt;a title=&#34;The Hard Questions&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p15g8X-Po&#34;&gt;troubling questions&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;d rather not deal with in our lives, demons that give us excuses to be complacent or hold ourselves back. To answer them is to face our own &lt;a title=&#34;Insecurity, the Root of All Evil&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/&#34;&gt;insecurities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/&#34;&gt;weaknesses&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I&#39;m going to dissect those demons so we can vanquish them and pursue our heroic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Many of these hard questions involve questioning the investment. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Am I really happy in this relationship?&#34; -- If the answer is no, it would mean ending a long-term emotional, time, and material investment. If we know the answer will be &#39;no,&#39; we may avoid asking the question at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;Why do I stay at a job I hate?&#34; -- The answer to this question often reveals perceived character flaws, things we&#39;d rather not believe about ourselves. Maybe we believe we aren&#39;t qualified for anything better, or we think quitting would make us look bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;People are reluctant to break up long-term relationships because they’ve already invested so much in them, or they are afraid to quit a job because they worked so hard to get it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A Choose-Your-Own-Reality Adventure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Why can&#39;t we just see an obvious answer, internalize it, and act on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The best explanation comes from a psychological theory called cognitive dissonance, which just sounds uncomfortable. It posits that humans have a natural inclination to seek consistency in our lives and actions. If we detect an inconsistency, we feel cognitive stress, which can manifest in a variety of ways from general anxiety up to psychosomatic disorders. Naturally, we will work to eliminate it, even if that means changing our beliefs (which is what the demons of mediocrity want). If we are successful, we can avoid the stress, but some things cannot be hidden, so even if we refuse to acknowledge them consciously, we still know there is an inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The classic illustration of this is Aesop&#39;s fable, &#34;The Fox and the Grapes&#34;:</description>

      <title>Investing in Yourself</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/investing-in-yourself/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/investing-in-yourself/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You experience a windfall and suddenly, your bank account is $1000 fatter. It&#39;s not a ton of money, but it&#39;s enough to give you some breathing room in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you pay off some of your student debt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you take a trip to India?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you buy a new dress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;a title=&#34;You May Be Illiterate&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-may-be-illiterate/&#34;&gt;learn how to program&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us would spend our money on things we want to fill a need or something we want to &lt;a title=&#34;How Much Do You Cost? How Much Do You Create?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-much-do-you-cost-how-much-do-you-create/&#34;&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if our default mode of spending was to invest in ourselves. Instead of having money leak out of the system, keep it in a cycle to generate more and more. Find ways to convert cash into personal capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Use that money to make yourself more valuable or increase your ability to generate value.</description>

      <title>If You Have to Cross a Moral Swamp, a Map is Always a Good Idea</title>

      <description>The e-mail I sent out this past weekend was about developing an awareness of the way we construct our morality and whether it restricts or enables us. In a nutshell:
 A morality basically tells us how we should behave to be happy/good people Moralities can be stated in two ways:  To be good, you must not-do/avoid/exclude X. To be good, you must do/include/experience Y.   While on the surface, the end result may be the same, the first morality leads to a sense of constant wariness, while the other leads to a stance of accepting life&#39;s opportunities.</description>

      <description>I was at the end of a particularly difficult workout, but I was confident because the final movement was one that I was especially good at: muscle-ups.
I ran over to the rings, jumped up and ripped out a single rep. I went for my second--and failed. I tried again--and failed. The clock was running out, so I didn&#39;t waste time with chalking my hands, collecting myself, or even setting my grip correctly.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve noticed an interesting trend among ambitious businesspeople: a tendency to neglect their health.
They seem to think that they can get away with treating their bodies poorly. In the pursuit of success, they end up pulling all-nighter after all-nighter, eating cheap, quick junk food to get back to work as soon as possible, drinking tons of coffee, and spending hours hunched over the keyboard.
I&#39;ve been in those kinds of situations, and I admire their dedication, but I&#39;ve also come to learn that a weak body leads to a weak mind.</description>

      <title>5 Ways to Boost Your Courage Right Now!</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/5-ways-to-boost-your-courage-right-now/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/5-ways-to-boost-your-courage-right-now/</guid>
      <description>Courage is a valuable commodity. Under various guises--moxie, confidence, spunk, gusto--you can turn a shaky idea into a winning proposition, or go from a wallflower to the life of the party. We crave just the FEELING of courage, even if it&#39;s only temporary and hollow, and have created a societal ritual around &#39;liquid courage&#39; and partying to chase that feeling.
Obviously, it&#39;s better to cultivate a more lasting kind of courage, but sometimes you just need a quick boost.</description>

      <description>There isn&#39;t a blog post for today because coping with the displacement caused by the Boulder floods has prevented me from finding the time to write. I did my best with the posts in the last week, but it finally caught up with me.
I do want to express how grateful I am to have such amazing friends, people who were willing to take us in on a moment&#39;s notice. A friend picked us up around 11pm in his car during the height of the flood on Wednesday night, after we&#39;d been evacuated.</description>

      <title>You May Be Illiterate</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/you-may-be-illiterate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/you-may-be-illiterate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Could you imagine turning in a resume that listed, &#34;Can read and write,&#34; as one of your notable skills? The idea is laughable, but at one point in history, that was a huge accomplishment and alone could secure you a job far above your station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, by which I mean the early Middle Ages, if you weren&#39;t born into the nobility, there were few ways to move up in the world. Military service was one option, but only worked in some places and times. Trade and mercantilism was another, but it required at least some capital to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most reliable ways was to learn how to read and write, to become literate&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a skill that was in extremely high demand--it was necessary for the conduct of the state and trade--and it was somewhat rare. Those who could convey, prepare, and understand written instructions were entrusted with important information and tasks and granted access to a world of continued learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, literacy became more or less universal. There were those who were more and less literate, but in general, anyone could read a book and write a letter, so you needed something more in order to be of value to those shaping society (or to shape it yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the age of computing (there were probably some other steps in there) and a thing arose called computer literacy. This involved being able to interact with a computer. The computer literate were not necessarily programmers, but they could operate a program and knew how to type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being computer literate opened up a lot of opportunities for you. Companies needed operators and you had a good chance of getting a job even if you weren&#39;t actually knowledgeable in the company&#39;s particular field. Just as a lowly, but literate, peasant might get a job as a merchant&#39;s bookkeeper, a kid who could troubleshoot Microsoft Office might work for a local bank without any financial expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lately, computer literacy has gone the way of word literacy: it has become universal and therefore taken for granted&lt;/strong&gt;. Computer literacy is expected.</description>

      <description>From one perspective, our world is broken. The ecosystem is collapsing, the majority of humans live isolated from nature, our society pushes unhealthy foods and inactivity, and it encourages immaturity while punishing us for impulsiveness.
Proponents of this belief think, &#34;If only the world matched the one that was best for us, we would all be healthy, fit, happy, and productive. If only the world were set up to encourage human potential, we wouldn&#39;t be so frustrated.</description>

      <description>I recently came across this article on Cracked (warning, it is quite inflammatory and contains a lot of strong language, as well as some offensive videos). As the name implies, it is a criticism of people&#39;s unwillingness to admit the reality of how the world works. It&#39;s targeted at my generation: the Millennials, which has been characterized by a sense of entitlement, aloofness, and a rejection of traditional notions of consumption and wealth (because we&#39;re poor, we&#39;ve made wealth into a sin).</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know what writers do to be great. All I know is that they write.
So I write.
And that&#39;s all I do, for now.
I&#39;m sure every situation is different. I&#39;m sure each person has a different path. I can&#39;t just copy the lifestyle or habits of one writer or another.
I have to make my own path.
The only thing they share is that they write.
Each of them creates.</description>

      <description>If you could boil your day down to one or two things, what would they be?
Yesterday, Anna and I met a father and husband in Boulder on a very unfortunate errand: bailing his 22-year-old son out of jail. He shared all sorts of stories about his life, his long marriage, and his career. He had spent time as a developer for schools, then as a contractor, but his real passion, he said, was restoring antique furniture.</description>

      <title>The Hard Questions</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-hard-questions/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-hard-questions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;He hated his job. The sterile thin air that assaulted him as soon as he walked into his office made him sick, and he was on edge until the minute he finally went home. He couldn’t stand his boss, didn’t have any friends among his co-workers, and found his job tedious. It was even affecting his life outside of work: it took him hours to unwind and he winced every time his phone chimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;His wife knew how bad it was for him, but the one time she had brought it up, he refused to talk about it, instead picking a fight. It wasn’t worth the anger, she decided, but she couldn’t stand watching him suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;One day, he came home in a rage, railing against his incompetent boss and some problem his wife couldn’t follow. She calmed him down, but then he just beat up on himself for not being able to handle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Finally, exasperated, she asked, “Why do you stay? Why do you put yourself through this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The automatic answer that almost escaped his lips was, “For us! I do this so we can live a comfortable life!” But he knew that wasn’t the real reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;A part of him knew the real answers. They had to do with winning his father’s respect, with his fear of starting over, with the fact that his sense of identity was tied up with his work. He knew the real reasons had nothing to do with ‘being a good partner’ or ‘supporting his family’. &lt;strong&gt;The real reasons were all things he didn’t want to believe were true about himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;So he never asked himself the hard questions that would bring the real reasons to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was easier to suffer, he decided, than to admit he had made a mistake.</description>

      <title>3 Reasons You Shouldn&#39;t Make Your Own Decisions</title>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/3-reasons-you-shouldnt-make-your-own-decisions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/deciding.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3183&#34; alt=&#34;deciding&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/deciding-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was recently looking for a good meal replacement option to make sure I get enough calories and protein on days when I don&#39;t have the time to prepare a good meal. While this may seem like a non-issue, I&#39;ve made a commitment to only eating whole foods, so it&#39;s a bit trickier than it seems. I know how to make this decision, because I&#39;ve done it before and I&#39;m certainly qualified, as a person who knows what&#39;s best for himself and as a trainer with a lot of experience dealing with nutrition. Yet, despite all that, my first inclination was to ask around with my trainer buddies, to check Paleo/Primal blogs, and to put the question to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even with the knowledge that I would make the best decision for myself without any input, I still wanted someone else to make the decision for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&#39;m the kind of person that &lt;a title=&#34;Insecurity, the Root of All Evil&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/insecurity-the-root-of-all-evil/&#34;&gt;questions my thinking&lt;/a&gt; process (in case you haven&#39;t picked up on that by now), I wanted to figure out why I felt the need to ask around. After all, I have rarely asked for input on what I should be doing for my own training. Ask 50 trainers what you should be doing and you&#39;ll get 50 different answers; it&#39;s really something you need to decide for yourself. Once you&#39;ve done that, then find a trainer who can help you reach that goal. I find it&#39;s better to make my own decisions and my own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not saying outside input isn&#39;t valuable. When you want to learn something, definitely seek out qualified teachers. I saw that Gold Medal Bodies was teaching a lot of people to do previously unattainable gymnastics skills, so I got &lt;a title=&#34;Review of Gold Medal Bodies Floor 1 Training Program&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/review-of-gold-medal-bodies-floor-1-training-program/&#34;&gt;one of their programs&lt;/a&gt;. But when you&#39;re making a decision, you already have all the information you need, and you know yourself well enough to know what&#39;s good for you, then asking for additional input is just pushing it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why was I hesitating and looking for outside opinions? I came up with a few answers.</description>

      <description>A short post, tracing the development of an idea.
I&#39;ve been struggling a lot with patience lately. Patience for myself and for others.
I&#39;m normally a really patient person, so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I&#39;ve been feeling so impatient lately. If I look at the way things have been going, I&#39;d have to say that the biggest change is a constant sense of insecurity regarding my financial life.</description>

      <title>6 Ways Accepting Your Weaknesses Can Empower You</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/6-ways-accepting-your-weaknesses-can-empower-you/</link>

      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/weakness.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3173&#34; alt=&#34;weakness&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/weakness-300x153.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;153&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the quirks of having subjective conscious experience (aka, self-awareness) is that we have a very different perspective on ourselves than we do on other people. For example, &lt;a title=&#34;Attribution Bias&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attribution bias&lt;/a&gt; tells us that we tend to assume other peoples&#39; actions are the result of their character more than their circumstances, while we openly acknowledge that we are affected by circumstances when it suits us. For example, if we see someone else lie to avoid a fine, we would tend to judge them as generally dishonest. If we do the same thing, we would cite our tight finances and tell ourselves that normally we&#39;re honest, law-abiding citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;However, this can create some interesting conflicts as well. We may assume we&#39;re stronger or more reliable than we really are, or that we will be happy in a situation that won&#39;t really make us happy. Maybe the idea of living in New York excites you, but you know that you hate cars and crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basically, we don’t like to admit that we are as flawed as other people, but if we are to be honest about who we are, if we are to live with integrity, we have to have an accurate view of ourselves, flaws and all.</description>

      <title>An Epic Tale of the Triumph of Will Over Utter Stupidity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on the travel blog I kept while living in Korea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_4519-e1331562897868.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had pretty much given up around the 20km mark. My left arch had been cramping since I passed 10km and my feet felt like the road was molten asphalt. I was still moving my feet, but it was more of a shuffle as I gingerly placed each step carefully to avoid even the tiniest jolt to my worn out suspension. I glared resentfully at every pair of cushy, padded, motion-controlled sneakers that cruised by me, their owners floating on a soft cloud of running technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had wondered if running a marathon in my &#39;barefoot&#39; Merrell Trailgloves was a good idea, but it turned out to be much worse than I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was only my second marathon. The first one I had run in racing flats, and I didn&#39;t think there would be too much difference, but it turns out half an inch of foam was the difference between crippling pain and a challenging run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also had a running partner the first time. My dad and I had jogged steadily around the streets of Philly, chatting and sharing observations about the city. Here, in South Korea, I was running alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked myself into putting one foot in front of the other. Somehow, I made it through the twenties and starting chipping away at kilometer 30, then 31, then 32. Each one seemed longer than the one before. With every...single...step my body wanted to stand still. &#34;Please let me walk, just two steps. I&#39;ll do anything!&#34; it begged me. Still I ran.&lt;img title=&#34;More...&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/trans.gif&#34; /&gt;</description>

I see this a lot among trainers, particularly those in unorthodox fitness methods like CrossFit and MovNat. We like to remind other people what they are doing wrong, how they are ignorant, unskilled, or lazy, too focused on strength/flexibility/skill and neglecting our pet trait, how they are clearly too wimpy to do &#39;real&#39; exercise, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is only natural. We&#39;ve put a lot of effort into unlocking the secretes of superpowers, so we want to enjoy the status that gives us. I did it all the time, until I remembered how incompetent I was when I started. &lt;/strong&gt;But it doesn&#39;t actually help anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;For example, I was working out with some friends the other day while another gym-goer was loudly, clumsily, doing his own workout. My buddies noticed and snickered, whispering among themselves how what he was doing was both dangerous and inappropriate for his apparent level of fitness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&#39;t the first time this particular group of friends had indulged in this kind of behavior, so I spoke up. &lt;strong&gt;First, I reminded them that the fact that he was out there at all, clearly pushing his limits and trying something new and challenging, was a good thing. Second, every single one of us in that group had gone through a similar phase when we did things that we realized were stupid in retrospect&lt;/strong&gt;. I tried a lot of weird things, some stupid and some legitimate but misplaced in my training:</description>

      <title>When Life Gets in the Way, What do You Do?</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bigrock.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3150&#34; alt=&#34;bigrock&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bigrock-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha -Mantra to Ganesh, Remover of Obstacles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the day before, and you&#39;ve committed to turning over a new leaf. Exercise, productivity, healthy eating, and overflowing compassion, starting tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to fit it in, you&#39;ll need to get up a bit earlier than usual. No problem, as going to bed early is part of your plan too. Off to bed at 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then your neighbor&#39;s dog gets loose in the middle of the night and her barking keeps you up for an hour. You wake up groggy when your alarm goes off at 6am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Gets in the Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, fueled by the passion of the untried, you make it out for your morning run. It&#39;s rough getting started, but once you hit your stride, your pace blows off the early morning cobwebs, and you return home invigorated and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, you dive right in to your to-do&#39;s, rather than checking your e-mail, chatting with your coworkers, and adjusting your seat as usual. By 11am, you&#39;re on track to finish your required work so that you can work on that special project of your own that will get you ahead in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, Mr. Garfield comes by with a request that you attend an &#34;emergency meeting&#34; right after lunch. Checking your schedule, you figure you can handle the slight delay and still stay on track if you eat at your desk. But, while you&#39;re doing that, Sarah comes by and says that she&#39;s going out of town tomorrow so she&#39;d like to discuss that important project with you over lunch. There goes your lunch break.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Listen to your intuition. It will tell you everything you need to know. - Anthony J. D&#39;Angelo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/brainhalves.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3144&#34; alt=&#34;brainhalves&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/brainhalves-300x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;He stood out among the other men at the table. He had a sense of practiced confidence about him, and whenever he spoke to the event facilitator--the only woman in the room--his responses seemed too playful, too well-rehearsed, and she laughed as if on cue. When it was his turn to introduce himself to the group, a label popped unsolicited into my head: pickup artist. I filed it to verify in time, and sure enough, he revealed that to be his background. Later during the workshop, he made vague reference to some challenges he was working on, without actually defining them. That voice in my head immediately supplied the details: trouble with commitment. Again, as the class progressed, he revealed that to be exactly his difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never considered myself to be a great judge of people. In college, I&#39;d meet particularly jovial people at parties thinking they were simply really happy, only to be told later that they were obviously drunk. I figured that if I couldn&#39;t identify the telltale signs of something so blatant as drunkenness, I should never trust my judgements about people.</description>

      <title>My Solution to the Meaning of Life</title>

      <description>I promised last week to explain the epiphany that led me to make peace with my fear of death. It was based on the realization that I am connected to all of my ancestors. This is going to get deep, so bear with me.
So here&#39;s the explanation. Zooming out from my personal experience of life, I&#39;m just one iteration of a genetic lineage. In fact, from a particular perspective, the real agent of this experience of existence is not me, Khaled, a human individual alive here and now, but rather the series of individual organisms connected by a genetic history.</description>

      <title>How Committing to Health Teaches you to Stand Out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sunflower.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-3114&#34; alt=&#34;sunflower&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sunflower.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Being in good shape puts you at odds with a lot of society. It denies--or at least minimizes--the value of some of our culture&#39;s greatest accomplishments: abundant food, two cars in every driveway, accessible technology, drugs for every ailment. It&#39;s generally poor form to question or refuse these blessings of civilization. It angers the other sheep when you start asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, our society is not structured to help individuals achieve their greatest potential in health. We&#39;ve done a very good job of eliminating the stressors that temper our bodies, with the result that our daily lives do not provide the stimulus we need to stay in our best shape. &lt;strong&gt;Now, if we want to develop our bodies, we have to go out of our way to do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be healthy, we need to take time out of our life in order to perform extensive and inconvenient maintenance (unless you&#39;re one of those people who &lt;em&gt;actually enjoys&lt;/em&gt; being active, then maybe you take time out of your life for your job). The alternative is to simply accept what most of the American population does: that chronic disease is inevitable, that the ability to lift and carry more than you weigh is impossible, that hoisting yourself over an object by your own strength is beyond human capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the norm, we have to eat differently, act differently, move differently, sleep differently. To a certain extent, we have to purposefully ostracize ourselves, choose certain friends that can support our habit, and stick out. Other&#39;s may respect and even envy health, but that doesn&#39;t make it any easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lifestyle sounds a lot like the one followed by many game-changers and amazingly successful people. From what I&#39;ve read and researched, starting a successful business that makes a difference requires you to live by a different set of rules. You do things and believe in possibilities that other people don&#39;t even consider. You question the status quo about money or the kind of influence you can have. You certainly don&#39;t play by the standard rules of go-to-school-get-good-grades-get-a-safe-job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So essentially, to break out of the status quo in anything, whether it&#39;s health, wealth, influence, or comedy, you have to be a radical&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <description>Nothing ventured, nothing gained. - Anon
 I marvel at how easy it is for me to do everything except the thing that I dream about: writing a novel. I can blog all day, train, teach fitness and self-defense, promote and market and teach myself Javascript. I make plans and schedules to make these things happen. But for some reason, I have a lot of trouble bringing the same discipline to bear on writing.</description>

      <title>Unlock the Vast Knowledge in Your Ancient DNA</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/unlock-the-vast-knowledge-in-your-ancient-dna/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/unlock-the-vast-knowledge-in-your-ancient-dna/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered a secret store of untapped skill and agility that anyone can use. I was out running on a trail with no shoes on, struggling mightily not to stub my toes on all the rocks and stones. It was mentally exhausting. I&#39;d just finished a novel: &lt;em&gt;God Emperor of Dune.&lt;/em&gt; One of the main characters in this book has conscious access to all his ancestor&#39;s memories and experiences, encoded in his DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; body also contains the DNA of all of my ancestors, millions of whom probably spent a lot of time running on rugged trails. In fact, encoded into my DNA and all that has arisen out of it are the instincts of tens of millions (maybe more) organisms, not all human, that spent their entire lives navigating wild, treacherous terrain. Along the way, there must have been some creation of an instinct that helped these creatures manage rocky trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, no matter how my life had progressed, &lt;strong&gt;I could not deny that there was in fact some remnant of all that history within me, if only in the way my DNA was constructed&lt;/strong&gt;. The experience of my ancestors, all the way back to the first proto-life, had created the blueprint for my existence and the framework around which my brain and nervous system were built. It seemed reasonable to think that perhaps there were some useful instincts prebuilt into me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to try something. I stopped consciously thinking about where to put my feet. I let go of the need to control my body and leaned forward to pick up speed, forcing my reflexes to direct my actions in order to avoid injury. I trusted my feet and my body&#39;s intelligence.</description>

      <description>Dwell not upon thy weariness, thy strength shall be according to thy desire. - Arab Proverb
 
In high school, I decided to become a vegetarian. At first, I was terrified and overwhelmed by the prospect of never eating meat again, but I realized that I didn&#39;t have to make such a large commitment at all. All I needed to do was to commit to not eating meat for that particular day.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/skull.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3084&#34; alt=&#34;skull&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/skull-202x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;202&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;ve been struggling with my mortality lately. Every few years, I go through periods of my life when I&#39;m hyperaware that I won&#39;t be around forever, that this is my only chance to live, and afterwards it will be Eternity of....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#39;m not unique in this way. All humans know they are going to die, and that awareness has been a driving force in human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how other people respond to that reality. I experience a compression of time, and all of a sudden, the decades between now and my death seem utterly trivial, the end as urgent and imminent as the next five minutes. It&#39;s really unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe in more compassionate explanations of existence than the walking-bag-of-chemical-reactions-becomes-worm-food. The Buddhist and Taoist concepts of universal oneness have a ring of truth to me. Of course, knowing that intellectually is very different from knowing it as a foundational principle of your worldview. Despite everything, I have to admit the dark, hopeless view often seems more real to me, even if it doesn&#39;t really make sense based on my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This awareness of the &lt;a title=&#34;The Imminence of Death&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-immanence-of-death/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;imminence of death&lt;/a&gt; has been a defining feature of my life since I was very young. It has shaped my worldview and left a strong impression on my sense of values. For a long time, I simply accepted it as a terrible curse, but &lt;strong&gt;I eventually realized that I could choose what it meant to me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I chose to to interpret it in a way that empowers me and allows me to be happy.</description>

      <title>Why Passion Isn&#39;t Enough</title>

      <description>The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense. - Thomas Edison
 No matter how determined you are in weightlifting or any sport, there are limits to your strength that are determined by your training. If you&#39;re a beginning lifter, it doesn&#39;t matter how badly you want it, you&#39;re not lifting 500lbs.
No matter how badly you want something or how hard you&#39;re willing to try, you can&#39;t get by on passion and verve alone.</description>

      <title>How to Find Your Bliss: 3 Questions to Ask Yourself</title>

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all well and good to tell people to follow their bliss, but how do you find the thing in the first place? If you haven&#39;t been following it, it probably wandered off years ago and is lost in someone&#39;s backyard howling all alone because you didn&#39;t follow it on the epic exploration of the neighborhood that would have led you to meet that cute neighbor you&#39;d fall in love with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, clearly you need to find it so you can follow it on to other adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the last weekend at the World Domination Summit, organized by Chris Guillebeau of &lt;a title=&#34;The Art of Non-Conformity&#34; href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;, where I was inundated by awesomely inspiring speakers and ideas. As the name implies, the World Domination Summit is a gathering of people intent of making a big impact on the world by living fearlessly and pursuing their remarkable dreams in a conventional world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one of the talks was specifically about how to find your passion or purpose, but several of the speakers touched on the topic. Three ideas in particular seemed especially actionable.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Wild lettuce is nearly inedible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How strange that this food, touted as one of the healthiest icons of a simple, wholesome diet, is not a food humans regularly consumed prior to the advent of agriculture. Wild carrots are woody and fibrous; wild avocados had hardly enough meat to be worth eating; bananas were so full of seeds they would be inedible to modern people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently learned all this watching a video entitled, &#34;&lt;a title=&#34;Debunking the Paleo Diet&#34; href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOjVYgYaG8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debunking the Paleo Myth&lt;/a&gt;&#34; (as usual, I&#39;m way behind the curve). I knew that much of Paleo was based on romantic  but unrealistic notions of Paleolithic cavemen and women living in an edenic utopia chasing mammoth for exercise and eating garden salads, but I had no idea how far off we were.</description>

      <description>... you should do it.
1. Because you can Sometimes that&#39;s the best reason of all: your potential, and the drive to realize it. You know you can run farther, love more truthfully, lift heavier, earn more, learn more. You know that you can do better.
Yet, day after day, you find yourself in the same place you were yesterday, not living up to your potential.
This starts to irritate you, but you try to be grateful for what you have.</description>

      <title>3 Unexpected Benefits of Natural Movement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/threedeer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3046&#34; alt=&#34;threedeer&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/threedeer.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started training with natural movements, as opposed to the contrived, isolated, and repetitive movements that used to make up the bulk of my training program, I was mainly interested in the obvious benefits: catlike reflexes, amazing strength, awe-inspiring toughness, and ninja skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I was focused on the physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I discovered after training this way for a while that it was changing me in other ways, too. I started to relate to my body differently than I had before, even during my years training CrossFit. Instead of feeling constantly inadequate, always being a step behind where I needed to be, I started to feel capable where I was right now, even as I trained to continue improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written extensively on the &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34;&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;How Moving Well Can Make You Confident and Popular&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/two-reasons-play-is-a-big-deal/&#34;&gt;mental&lt;/a&gt; benefits of natural movement, and plenty of other people have as well, so I just wanted to share some of the less obvious benefits I&#39;ve found from my training.</description>

      <title>The Smiling Swordsman</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-smiling-swordsman/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474-e1371668311238.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3029&#34; alt=&#34;rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474-e1371668311238.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We once fought together for an ideal with our swords. It wasn&#39;t for power or for glory, but to create a peaceful world where people could live without fear. And, if you should forget about that, then what did we fight the revolution for? &lt;em&gt;- Himura Kenshin, &lt;/em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin Anime Series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend recently introduced me to an anime series called Rurouni Kenshin, about a young man name Himura Kenshin who was an assassin during the Meiji Restoration, a massive revolution in 19th century Japan. The Meiji Restoration&#39;s greatest effect was the transference of political power from the militaristic, samurai-controlled Tokagawa Shogunate, which had ruled for 200 years, back to the emperor and his ministers. It also marked the start of modernization, both technologically and socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I want to take a moment to express how lucky and grateful I am to have a girlfriend who insists I watch anime series).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenshin was renown as the greatest assassin during the revolution, but the show is actually about him trying to renounce his bloody past and help Japan solidify its new peace. In one episode, his friend points out that Kenshin, of all people, feels the most anger towards the new government because he fought so hard to bring it into existence, only to find it just as exploitative and full of corruption. However, unlike many other characters in the series, Kenshin doesn&#39;t see this as justification for continued strife and fighting. Even with the corruption of the new government, he would rather do what he can to ease the lives of everyday people than support another bloody revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He is able to look past his personal feelings and the short-sighted agendas of those he deals with to see the effects on the people of Japan. There is sometimes an air of resignation about him--he must accept the lesser of two evils to preserve peace--but he also carries a lot of hope and faith in the innate goodness of humanity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenshin&#39;s character is very interesting for a number of reasons, but the thing that inspires me the most is how he &lt;strong&gt;tries to enjoy the little moments of every day&lt;/strong&gt;. He is usually seen smiling, playing with children, making silly jokes, and generally enjoying life. When a villain shows up with the intention of taking advantage of the weak or causing mayhem, Kenshin puts them in their place very quickly, but for the most part, he tries to appreciate his new life and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenshin epitomizes the Warrior Spirit, combining a deep and ruthless concern for the well-being of others with a determination to experience life as joyful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the series, there are many characters who respond to the results of revolution much differently, stubbornly fixating on something that upsets them. They may have good intentions, but more often than not, they end up as villains. &lt;strong&gt;Their anger and frustration drive them to acts of violence that hurt others or threaten a return to a state of war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We Create a World to be Bitter In&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes worry about crossing that line. I see a lot to be upset about in the world.</description>

      <title>Choosing Hope</title>

      <description>Wandering the bookstore, I am always amazed at the wide variety of interests and ideas humans cultivate and share. There are people who spend months or years working on books about what I consider trivial topics and stories about everything under the sun. I feel amazed at the power of the human spirit and our many stories, the sheer richness of our culture and civilization.
This contrasts strongly with a general misanthropy I&#39;ve noticed among some of my communities, particularly the local food and paleo/ancestral health communities.</description>

      <description>Boulder&#39;s magic strikes again.
I was out for a barefoot run last week and decided to explore a new trail. I was getting the usual stares, when one woman held my gaze. I smiled politely, and she did too, but she didn&#39;t just turn back to her hike. Instead, she yelled, &#34;Another barefooter like me!&#34; I saw shoes, but when I stopped, I realized they were light moccasins. We walked a while together until we reached a side trail where she removed her shoes.</description>

      <title>Your Superhuman Heritage</title>

&lt;p&gt;We all dream of becoming something more than we are, of surpassing the everyday. We have an urge to outgrow ourselves: be more healthy, more wealthy, more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we act on that, and sometimes we don&#39;t, but it&#39;s always there, tickling at the back of our minds. &#34;How wonderful it would be to transcend my limitations?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, one of the most chafing limitations has always been where I can go and what my body is capable of. Whenever I watch movies or even cartoons about exceptional warriors, martial artists, and heroes, I am always surprised by how I feel seeing those fancy moves. &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s not awe so much as jealousy, a sense that, not only do I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be able to do that, I believe that I &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be able to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I have to keep in mind that most of these shows and stories are fiction, and most of the moves are performed by stunt doubles with the aid of special effects. But there are exceptional humans out there who are not always Olympic or world champion level: club gymnasts, strongmen and women, marathoners and ultra-runners, powerlifters, traceurs, rocks climbers, dancers, athletes, Shaolin monks, stuntmen. Anyone from any walk of life can become accomplished in any of these feats that transcend what we consider normal for a human being. They may not break any world records, but a 2x bodyweight deadlift is a significant achievement, and puts you in the top range of (modern, industrialized) humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But maybe it&#39;s not about becoming something more than what we are. Maybe it&#39;s about expressing what we already have within us.</description>

      <description>“Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.” - Aristotle
 Every moment of every day is full of choices. Some choices are trivial and some have life-altering consequences.
 Laugh or get angry Eat healthy or eat conveniently Read or watch TV Walk or run Play or work Love or hate Marriage or dating Create or consume College or work Write or don&#39;t  There are No Turning Points I often catch myself thinking that I need some big event to &#39;turn over a new leaf&#39; or otherwise start living the life I want/being the person I want to be.</description>

      <description>Utah&#39;s Canyonlands National Park contains some of the most beautiful and harsh landscape in the world, so when I had the chance to bike and camp through it last month, I was excited to explore the terrain away from the campsite. That first evening, I headed up a rocky slope within sight of camp to really experience the landscape up close.
When I got back, it turned out I had upset one of the people I was traveling with, who saw my actions as foolishly dangerous, citing the possibility of me slipping or a tumbling rock causing me to fall.</description>

      <title>Distraction and Fascination</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature presents the young with something so much greater than they are; it offers an environment where they can easily contemplate infinity and eternity. - Richard Louv, &lt;em&gt;Last Child in the Woods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two children. Both are staring wide-eyed at something, utterly entranced, mouths slightly open. Now back up from each kid and add some context: the first is staring at a TV set, and the second is staring at &lt;a title=&#34;5 Stories of A Little Boy in Nature&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/5-stories-of-a-little-boy-in-nature/&#34;&gt;a spider weaving its web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between nature observation and watching TV?&lt;/strong&gt; Both involve sitting motionless for long periods of time, observing something else, without much interaction on your part beyond the sensory, and letting your mind get carried off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But one is distracting while one is fascinating, and I think that is an important distinction to make.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;em&gt;Last Child in the Woods, &lt;/em&gt;Richard Louv introduced me to the concept of fascination as that thing a natural setting does to children who have the free time and access to explore it. Fascination is what happens when children&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;True compassion is true understanding. - Attributed to the Buddha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worst nightmare is standing behind the checkout counter at the local supermarket. He has been working there every day for 17 years, 8-10 hours. He goes to bed knowing that, upon waking, all he has to look forward to is another day, another week, another month, another year of standing at the same counter, scanning other peoples&#39; stuff, much of it stuff he can&#39;t afford. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s come to enjoy the job, but he has become numb to the quiet panic that pervades every one of his days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m describing an archetype, not an actual person, the life I don&#39;t want to lead, but a life I know many people do live. It is a life I cannot comprehend and one I&#39;m terrified of finding myself in. Knowing others who live it makes me uneasy because of the assumptions I have about human potential. I don&#39;t know anyone who aspires to being a cashier, and the mindset that can be happy and accept it is one I simply don&#39;t understand.</description>

      <description>Do one thing everyday that scares you. - Eleanor Roosevelt
 After practicing movement and martial arts for so long, I sometimes lose track of the reasons I started in the first place. Lately, I&#39;ve been on a bit of a hiatus, but I was able to get some training time in last weekend. The combination of time off plus the intensity of training reminded me of why I do this in the first place, and, more importantly, why I want to do this every single day.</description>

      <title>Priorities: Matching Reality to Your Values</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/213085702_8d5e812d9d.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2958&#34; alt=&#34;New Changed Priorities Ahead&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/213085702_8d5e812d9d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upon returning from my trip to Utah, I&#39;ve found myself caught in a whirlwind of activity, trying to catch up with all sorts of projects. This hasn&#39;t given me time to act on the important things that are normally part of my routine, nor the amazing insights I gained in the desert of the Canyonlands. That&#39;s one reason this post is late. It is a pattern I&#39;ve noticed in myself before, when I lived in Korea and was trying to establish a match between the life and wanted and the life I ended up living.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, it&#39;s good to take stock of how closely the life you&#39;re actually living matches the life you want to be living. Are the things that are important to you getting their due, or are they just sitting on the back burner, day after day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I find that stress tends to lead me to give up on my routines and plans with the excuse of surviving or making do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s like that saying about putting your head down and plowing through. You don&#39;t know (or don&#39;t want to know) where you&#39;re going, you just need to get through whatever&#39;s in front you, as fast as possible, without regard to finesse or tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the problem with doing that is that sometimes you move forward only to look up to find yourself somewhere you didn&#39;t mean to go&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you&#39;ve got to go back or find another way. You&#39;ve wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or worse, because you haven&#39;t taken the time to plot your course, you end up barreling into another crisis situation, and the only way to deal with that is to do the same thing that got you there in the first place. Then, you become a slave to events, moving in the direction set by each crisis. At first, you are just telling yourself, &#34;I just need to get through this week, then everything will be back on track.&#34; But when that week passes, you haven&#39;t taken the time to set your course, and it becomes another week or &#39;getting through,&#39; then another, then another, until you find yourself lost.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I was asked the question, &#34;Do you direct your experiences, or allow experiences to happen to you?&#34;
I had to pick an answer in the middle somewhere, because while I normally feel that I should take an active role in my life, lately I have felt that I am intended as an instrument for something. When I am doing the &#39;wrong&#39; thing, my life seems very difficult, like swimming upstream.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is shared with my &lt;a title=&#34;Warrior Spirit Movement&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/move&#34;&gt;movement training website&lt;/a&gt;. Head over there if you&#39;re curious about learning to move with power and grace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I &lt;a title=&#34;I’m Moving to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;live in Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, I have the great opportunity to &lt;a title=&#34;The Communion of Play; A Day of Natural Movement on the River&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-communion-of-play-a-day-of-natural-movement-on-the-river/&#34;&gt;share my love of natural, playful, useful movement&lt;/a&gt; with the great community of the University of Colorado at Boulder. With its thriving athletics community and the fact that it is the heart of &lt;a title=&#34;The Greenwashing of Exercise&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-greenwashing-of-exercise/&#34;&gt;outdoor- and wellness-obsessed&lt;/a&gt; Boulder, CU is the perfect place to introduce young athletes to the concept that exercise doesn&#39;t have to be a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, I have to prove my skills to the head of the fitness department, and while&lt;strong&gt; I do this stuff because I want to &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34;&gt;flow like a wild animal ninja through the woods&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; I knew I&#39;d have to tone it down a bit to avoid alienating her. On Tuesday, I had my interview. Here is how it went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived early to make sure I had time to orient myself to the facilities. The head of the department had structured the interview as a &#39;Snapshot&#39; training session; I would be training one of CU&#39;s established trainers, who would be acting as a naive client. We met outside the locker room, I got changed, and we headed up to the massive weight and cardio room that serves the CU student population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked by rows and rows of weight machines and treadmills, I began to doubt myself. It was clear that the status quo was well-entrenched here. I didn&#39;t want to estrange my &#39;client&#39;, who, as a trainer herself, would probably have some very strong opinions about what was legitimate and what was &lt;a title=&#34;Are You as Fit as Your Dog? 5 Ways to Play Fetch&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/are-you-as-fit-as-your-dog-5-ways-to-play-fetch/&#34;&gt;ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had two choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Follow the program I had drafted, which was a standard weight loss/strength/&#39;firming up&#39; sequence, with some MovNat thrown into the warmup, OR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Really emphasize the natural movement and blow her mind, hoping that she would get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the latter.</description>

      <description>The problem with charging people for a service is that it limits who is worthy of being helped.
I&#39;ve been in the position of being someone who is really passionate about learning a skill, and would make the perfect student, but who cannot afford something. It never felt fair because it suggests that only rich people can be skilled or learned or whatever.
If I believe that people will benefit from learning how to be more in-tune with their bodies, to move with power and grace, then presumably this applies to all people.</description>

      <description>I was recently featured on the MovNat blog, talking about how much of a pansy I am (sort of). I thought I&#39;d just share that article for today.
One thing they never tell you about barefoot running is how painful it can be. When you step out on a trail for your first totally unshod trek, eager to run wild and free though the forest, you are suddenly struck with an unexpected problem: tiny pebbles.</description>

      <description>How do you define your personal success? When asked what you want in life, do you tell people the job you want to do, or the kind of company and environment you want to work for, or the effect you want to have on the world?
Yesterday, I was meeting with a mentor to figure out what I needed to do to be successful and happy in Boulder now that I&#39;ve quit my job, and to understand why I felt the need to quit my job in the first place (oh yeah, Mom and Dad, by the way, I quit my job.</description>

      <description>This post is cross-published on my coaching blog, Warrior Spirit Movement.
Most mornings, I head out into the mountains, not to hike, but to ramble. I go where my heart leads me, over rocks, up trees, through fields. And when I am on the trail, I move over it in my own way, hopping from rock to rock or crawling along past wary hikers and excited dogs. Moving in these ways has me sprinting, swinging, scrambling, leaping, reaching, and everything but “Hiking.</description>

      <description>My new theory on success is based on techniques I developed annoying my sister, applied to the universe (thanks, L).
Here is how it works:
 I say something I want to be right about: Mommy likes me better. She says the opposite, or simply refutes my argument: Nuh uh! I persist: Uh huh! We repeat the process until one of us tires and the other person&#39;s perception is accepted as fact.</description>

      <description>One of the greatest literary and artistic accomplishments of Western civilization is an illuminated Bible created in medieval Ireland called The Book of Kells. It contains some of the most intricate illustration anywhere, despite the fact that it was created at a time when having your town pillaged by Vikings was a very real threat and Adobe Illustrator was not yet invented.
What fascinates me about The Book isn&#39;t the beautiful illumination.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t go into the mountains to enjoy them or relax or work up a sweat. I go simply to be among them.
 I have lately picked up the habit of going on morning hikes. I have about an hour before work, so I see how far I can get into the Front Range before I have to turn back. So far, it&#39;s been a meditative experience. I leave the house burdened with worries and concerns, stuck inside my head and trapped by my thoughts, and I return feeling lighter, clear-headed, and open.</description>

      <title>The 80/20 Principle in Training</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-8020-principle-in-training/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-8020-principle-in-training/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2889&#34; align=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;576&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/16761_702845749494_1943566062_n-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2889 &#34; alt=&#34;Dunebashing: 80% Play, 20% Sweat&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16761_702845749494_1943566062_n-1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;386&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dunebashing: 80% Play, 20% Sweat[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;This was a concept that I had trouble understanding from my MovNat trainer certification. I have read &lt;a title=&#34;Book Review: The 80/20 Principle&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch&lt;/a&gt;, so it was more an issue of understanding how to apply it to physical adaptation than a failure to grasp the concept. This article is what I came up with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The few things that work fantastically well should be identified, cultivated, nurtured, and multiplied. - Richard Koch, &lt;em&gt;The 80/20 Principle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80% of our results comes from 20% of our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 80/20 rule in a nutshell. It means that only 20% of our effort is responsible for most of our results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of our clients supply 80% of our income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% of our work time is when we get 80% of our assignments done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We watch 20% of our movie collection 80% of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that last one may not be totally accurate. Perhaps, if you&#39;re me, it&#39;s more like you watch 10% of your movie collection 90% of the time, but the point is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of our results come from a surprisingly small minority of our efforts or resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news, because it means we can cut out 80% of the busy work and dedicate more of our time to the 20% that actually makes a difference. Or we can retain 80% of our current results and spend much less time on achieving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In training, that means we should focus on the exercises that make the most difference to our health and ability&lt;/strong&gt;. These would be exercises that trigger a powerful, full-body adaptation response. Heavy strength training would be preferable to isolation biceps curls, for example (sorry biceps curls, I know everyone picks on you).</description>

      <title>Discovering a New Passion in Cooking</title>

More importantly, I can do it again[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve never considered myself a culinary person. I was never very good at picking up my mom&#39;s recipes as a kid, and I needed a cookbook and a measuring spoon to prepare grilled cheese (I&#39;m not exaggerating at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I became more insistent on healthy eating in college, I had to learn basic cooking technique; if you insist on whole foods, you need to be able to prepare them yourself. This resulted in a lot of stir-fries at first. The only animal I was comfortable handling was fish. I slowly added a simple recipe and a few techniques to my repertoire (mostly via hurried phone calls to my mom, who demonstrated an amazing ability to rescue even my most ill-conceived cooking adventures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned to cook red meat, I learned to braise, I learned to roast and broil and sauté. I learned knife technique and how to poach an egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then, somewhere along the line, I stopped looking up recipes&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, I would imagine what I wanted to eat and mentally map out the steps to get there, complete with sequence of ingredients, temperature, cook times, heating techniques, and spices. I had done enough trial and error (the errors stuck the most) that I had created a cooking toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t realize I had crossed into amateur chefdom until recently, when I was able to have an informed conversation with a French-trained chef about flavor combinations and methods of preparation and ingredient quality. I think that may have been &lt;a title=&#34;Lessons Learned About Landing a Job in Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-about-landing-a-job-in-boulder/&#34;&gt;why he hired me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I realized the recipes I was coming up with were getting fairly complex. Whereas before I might have settled on broiling a fish fillet and some chopped vegetables, now I was browning spiced chicken, caramelizing brussel sprouts, braising them for an hour in ale, and then crisping them under the broiler for the last 10 minutes, just because it seemed like it would be tasty that way.</description>

      <title>5 Stories of A Little Boy in Nature</title>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_1618.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-2874&#34; alt=&#34;DSC_1618&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_1618-1024x685.jpg&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;383&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up this morning and sat on the edge of my futon to meditate, A&#39;s breathing setting the backdrop for my own deeper, regulated breath. I had finally managed to wake up early enough that the apartment was silent; there were no dogs scrabbling around in the kitchen, and our roommate was still asleep as well. I was determined to make the most of this time when it would be easier to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sitting, I picked up a book I&#39;d been intending to start for months, &lt;i&gt;Last Child in the Woods.&lt;/i&gt; I read a few pages into the first chapter, remembering stories my dad used to tell about exploring the forest just outside town, hunting squirrels with a rifle. The book is about the epidemic of what the author calls, &#34;nature deficit disorder,&#34; a condition arising from a severe and notable lack of interaction with the natural world in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to think about my own experiences with nature and came up with very little. I had hated leaving my precious computer games and Nintendo as a child, but when I really thought about it, I did spend quite a lot of time outdoors. Some of my strongest memories were formed in the natural world.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy to announce that I have finally landed a job in Boulder, which means that I can stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, &lt;a title=&#34;Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;keeping upbeat&lt;/a&gt; in the face of difficult prospects has been hard. Especially going into March, which would have been the limit of my savings, I was worried I was going to hit a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luckily, just as I reached the end of my financial rope, a job came through&lt;/strong&gt;. Funny how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, now I have the issue of having too many things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual workaday job at the grocery store, I was also given my first tutoring assignment, and landed my first paid freelance magazine article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34;&gt;Coaching MovNat&lt;/a&gt; is still my preferred form of employment, but that hasn&#39;t resulted in any paying arrangements. However, I&#39;m still giving it as much attention as I can spare, going around to gyms and studios offering to run workshops and introduce myself to as wide an audience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that I will use the consistent job to get established while developing more lucrative opportunities that allow me to work on my own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period of my life is certainly one of the most challenging and uncomfortable, but I can tell it is also fostering a lot of growth. It&#39;s the kind of uncomfortable experience that you know is good for you, even if you&#39;d rather not have to go through it. Sort of like exercise (which I guess I&#39;m fairly good at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few short lessons I&#39;ve learned:</description>

      <description>I am small.
I am new to this dog park. I don&#39;t have many friends, and my collar is a hand-me-down.
I am young, and know little of the ways of the big dogs.
I&#39;m not a purebred, that&#39;s for sure.
I still have a lot of tricks to learn, and I&#39;m not terribly good at the ones I do know.
I am an underdog.
But if you think you can bark me out of here, you are dead wrong.</description>

      <title>A Seon Templestay in Korea</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-seon-templestay-in-korea/</link>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we get too caught up in the busyness of the world, we lose connection with one another - and ourselves. - Jack Kornfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2851&#34; align=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;717&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_9400-Version-2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2851 &#34; alt=&#34;Photo credit: Anna &amp;quot;Rocketpack&amp;quot; Pusack&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_9400-Version-2-1024x685.jpg&#34; width=&#34;717&#34; height=&#34;479&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Photo credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rocketpackphoto.com&#34;&gt;Anna &#34;Rocketpack&#34; Pusack&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke abruptly in a pitch dark cell, wrapped in pre-dawn silence. Suddenly, the distant wooden bell that had woken me rang out again, accompanied by the ghostly chanting of a Korean Seon (Zen) monk whose duty it was to rouse fellow monks, visiting foreigners, and stubborn Korean teenagers. The sounds faded quickly, swallowed by the forests and mountains around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 4:00am. The world gave no indication that morning was in the schedule. I had come here exactly for the discipline of this simple temple life, but even I found it difficult to rouse myself this early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bell and the chanting monk came closer, moving out of the mystical realm into the waking world. It was time to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I folded my blankets, pulled on my jacket, slid out the heavy wooden door of my sleeping cell, and started up the mountain to join the others in a session of Buddhist chanting and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping into a small, close shrine, I took my place at a meditation cushion. My girlfriend and I had been taught the day before how to do the introductory bows, and we went through them now, knees and backs aching. Soon, everyone had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monk rang a clapper and all was silent. Then, as abrupt and distinct as the lone wooden bell, chanting rang out and engulfed the room. We were carried away in its driving, insistent rhythm that thrummed like a force of nature through our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Buddha awoke within us like a lotus, coaxed from sleep by the relentless, comforting chants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began my templestay at Golgulsa Temple in Gyeong-ju, South Korea.</description>

      <title>No Egos Beyond This Point</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/no-egos-beyond-this-point/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;If your practice is good, you may become proud of it. What you do is good, but something more is added to it. Pride is extra. Right effort is to get rid of something extra. - Shunryu Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/humbledog.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2843&#34; alt=&#34;SONY DSC&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/humbledog.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The theme of this year is definitely &lt;a title=&#34;Empower Yourself Through Humility&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empower-yourself-through-humility/&#34;&gt;humility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this annoying habit of questioning authority in all its forms, even when it&#39;s authority I normally support, i.e., my MovNat trainers at my &lt;a title=&#34;Playing in the Woods, Mountain Lions, and Braised Chicken&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/playing-in-the-woods-mountain-lions-and-braised-chicken/&#34;&gt;recent certification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was well run and everyone got a lot out of it, but at one point, I found something to pick on and made a big deal out of nothing. I realize, looking back, that I had primed myself for a confrontation by the attitude I brought in to the certification, which was one of proving myself rather than learning something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it all went down, I was pretty upset, not so much with the trainers, who handled it very professionally, but with myself for being bothered and for feeling the need to do or say anything. After all, it wasn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;workshop, nor was it my responsibility. I spent a troubled evening losing sleep and &lt;strong&gt;trying to figure out what it was inside me that was causing me so much anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually figured out it was the desire to prove myself rather than let go and simply learn. I reached out to my sister for advice, and she wisely suggested &lt;strong&gt;I make a distinction between observation (learning) and judging (reacting)&lt;/strong&gt;. So, the next morning, after a sincere and humbling apology (damage control), I made a point of simply observing and withholding judgement for the remaining three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, I learned a lot more that way than with my original approach.</description>

      <description>Training for my MovNat certs has been exhilarating in a lot of ways. Unfortunately, it means I have been totally swamped between preparing for them, preparing for the workshops I&#39;m leading in Boulder later this week, and actual training, which means this is the only blog post for today. Sorry. I&#39;ll try to get something more substantial up on Wednesday.
Just some highlights of what I&#39;ve been up to:
 We spent the entire day outdoors, exploring parks and trails and looking or movement opportunities.</description>

      <title>The Little Chieftain; Are You Waiting for Permission to Live?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2834&#34; alt=&#34;The Chief&#39;s Headdress&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once was a tribe of people living in an ancient land. They chose from among their number one to lead them, a chief, who was the most skilled in hunting, diplomacy, and wisdom. He or she was to be a beacon for the tribe, a person to inspire a sense of belonging and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, as the current chief was dying, there were two candidates to replace her. Both boys were truly skilled in the art of warriorship, and both possessed wisdom beyond their years. They were of the same age, at the cusp of manhood, but one still acted like a little boy. He felt like someone or something had to give him permission to be a man. The other acted as if manhood were already his. He took an air of fatherhood around the children and acted like an equal among the elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the tribe still had trouble deciding, for both boys were exceptionally skilled and passed all the tests of intellect and insight. After a long day being interviewed, the two of them found themselves alone in the chief&#39;s room, the elders having retired to discuss. Sitting in the back of the room were the chieftain&#39;s robes and headdress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As boys are wont to do, they grew curious about that which is forbidden them, and finally they decided try on these magical garments. They had been fashioned for an adult, and clearly would fit neither boy, but they wanted to feel what it would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first boy threw the robe around his scrawny shoulders and lowered the headdress over his brow. His friend only barely managed to stifle a laugh, and truly the boy in the robes felt strange and uncomfortable. He hunched, as if trying to get away from the feathers that adorned his head. They robes didn&#39;t fit, physically or otherwise, but he assumed they would feel more comfortable over time, just as his bow had felt awkward until he had taken it on several hunts. He knew that if he were selected, the tribe&#39;s permission would give him the certainty he needed to fill the outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the other boy donned the garb, and the large robe slipped down his narrow shoulders. But when the first boy looked on his friend smiling and standing tall under the too-large headdress, he saw that this boy wore the cloak and feathers like they were already his. The way he stood, the way he bore them proudly instead of uncertainly, said that he could already see himself as the chief. Perhaps there were skills to be learned, but this boy was not shy of being called chief and being looked to for guidance. Though the garb didn&#39;t fit physically, it seemed to belong to this boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first boy told his friend what he saw and he left the room to tell the elders he was withdrawing. And the little chief who had always been a chief led his tribe on to many great victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;I’m Moving to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;Having arrived in Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, I set about trying to establish a life here. Income was (is) hard to come by. I live in a shared apartment, and I&#39;ve applied to a lot of part-time jobs to try to get things started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;It&#39;s pretty scary sometimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met a guy, not even my age, who goes to work in a suit and tie, who owns his own condo, and who doesn&#39;t just work because he needs a bit of money as he sets up for his next step, but who is a contributing member of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am quite mature in regards to psychology, emotional intelligence, and personal integrity, but &lt;strong&gt;in terms of my material prosperity, I still envision my life like a student, someone dependent, in transition.</description>

      <title>A World Unto Yourself: The Ecological Nature of Health</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/86898565_563dab2319.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2828&#34; alt=&#34;Earth Full South Pacific&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/86898565_563dab2319.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;456&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know thyself. - Plato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body is a wonderfully complex organism. It puts even the most refined watches to shame in terms of the technical precision that enables it to run, and the ingeniousness with which the human (or any other) body is put together continues to astound doctors, philosophers, psychologists, biologists, theologians, and anyone else who witnesses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite this deep complexity, &lt;strong&gt;we often treat our bodies like simple machines&lt;/strong&gt;. We believe that we can change one thing without accounting for anything else. This comes across in the many fitness fads of bulking up vs. cutting vs. toning, as if our bodies were cars that could be tweaked and fine-tuned. All you need to do is lift heavier, or follow this one routine, or eat this one superfood, or take cold showers.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“When you have come to the edge Of all light that you know And are about to drop off into the darkness Of the unknown, Faith is knowing One of two things will happen: There will be something solid to stand on or You will be taught to fly.” - Patrick Overton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be honest: while I write about taking big risks and facing your fears, I have always had the luxury of &lt;a title=&#34;Why Is It Taking So Long to Move Out?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-is-it-taking-so-long-to-move-out/&#34;&gt;financial security from my parents&lt;/a&gt;. After college, I moved home and worked from there, and in 2011, I moved to Korea as a contracted ESL teacher, a job that came with housing and a steady paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Can I Preach It, if I Don’t Live It?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/can-i-preach-it-if-i-dont-live-it/&#34;&gt;That doesn&#39;t make what I write about any less valid&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve heard from many of my readers how they have taken my words to heart and faced up to challenges in their lives, making changes for the better despite great fear and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps having never faced that particular rite of passage that is moving out on my own, my philosophy is missing the certainty of one who has been tempered by experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now I&#39;m being called to live up to my own advice in a very urgent way. Having &lt;a title=&#34;I’m Moving to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;moved to Boulder&lt;/a&gt; at the end of January with no more than a light bank account, I&#39;ve been working frantically to find or make work for myself. &lt;strong&gt;Staring at a shrinking bank statement really drives home whether or not I have faith in what I write about&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I&#39;ve learned so far:</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler; solitude will not be solitude, poverty will not be poverty, nor weakness weakness.” - Henry David Thoreau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no surprise to followers of ancestral living that, when it comes to health, less is often more. Of course, we mean less of the right things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Less additives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Less sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Less processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less cushioning in our shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less furniture (remember the evils of sitting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, we like living as close to our natural state as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a title=&#34;The 6 Strangest Health Habits&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-6-strangest-health-habits/&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; a while back about about my strange health habits that have made a big difference for me, and I realized that many of them also helped me save money. I used to have quite a lot of hygiene products in my never-ending attempts to maintain a healthy body. These included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;handsoap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;bodywash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;shampoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;conditioner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;shaving cream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;aftershave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chemical deodorant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I was spending a lot of money on products that are basically unnecessary. Even eco-friendly products often have a lot of unnecessary stuff in them, and of course the &#39;green&#39; label justifies charging more for them. It didn&#39;t make sense to me that humans needed such complex chemicals just to stay clean. So I started learning about alternatives and DIY-recipes. I&#39;ve since reduced my products down to the following:</description>

      <title>Empower Yourself Through Humility</title>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/empower-yourself-through-humility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/16112_700950337914_589075632_n-e1360535516995.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2802&#34; alt=&#34;Bowing Before the Buddha&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16112_700950337914_589075632_n-e1360535516995.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;545&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility reminds us that we are human. It reminds us not to overestimate our abilities, not to get sloppy and lazy, to always be present and give our best effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility reminds us that the big tasks, the ones that matter, really are difficult, even for such amazing warriors as ourselves. &lt;strong&gt;Remembering this, we will remain focused, taking the task seriously and bringing to it the attention it deserves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility says, &#34;I could mess this up, so I will make sure I don&#39;t.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the fool forgoes humility for hubris. If he is talented, he will get far, but eventually, the task at hand will be bigger than he can handle casually. Eventually, it will require an acceptance of the need for help, either from other people or deeper wells of energy and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve adopted the habit of bowing upon waking and just before bed. Bowing is an interesting form of devotion because it is an expression of humility. You are honoring whatever you bow to by being humble before it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that suggests an acknowledgement of how much we rely on certain things and how important mindfulness is. I recite certain gratitudes when I bow. For example, I give thanks for the opportunity to rest and recover at night, and then I bow. This expresses the acknowledgement that I don&#39;t necessarily have the right to peaceful rest -- many people don&#39;t get it. I am thankful for it, but also humbled by it, since I depend on it to function.</description>

      <title>How to Get Others to Inspire Your Growth</title>

&lt;p&gt;Standing on the broken edge of the Earth that had been thrust up out of the ground thousands of years ago but still as jagged as ever, I gazed across a chasm occluded by falling snow. On the other side was wild mountain forest, filling in the gaps of another chunk of tectonic rock that had been forcibly pried into the sky by the Rockies beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could think of no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;This was the life I wanted for myself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I were honest, I would never have brought myself out here on my own. I owed the motivation for this trip to a new friend, and to the community that makes a spur-of-the-moment jaunt into the mountains a reasonable possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to my own devices, I would have been at home, safely tucked into my comfort zone, watching the snow fall and wondering if I was really living up to the Boulder lifestyle.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2782&#34; align=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;576&#34;]&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2782 &#34; alt=&#34;Meditation is time well-spent; it tempers the soul to face the challenges of the world&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/418990_684481541514_706652743_n.jpg&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;386&#34; /&gt; Meditation is time well-spent; it tempers the soul to face the challenges of the world. &lt;em&gt;Credit: Anna Pusack&lt;/em&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” - Buddha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I entertained lofty notions of fixing many of the world’s problems. However, I did not feel up to the task. Despite my ambitions, I felt fearful and weak. Whenever I contemplated tackling the big issues, I saw them as far beyond my capabilities. &lt;strong&gt;But instead of focusing on increasing my capabilities, I instead tried to think of ways I could tackle these challenges with just what I had at the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was that I felt constantly overwhelmed. In high school, I spent most of my time despairing how ineffective I was. In college, I did what a lot of people do: I stopped caring and focused on enjoying my life, often through distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I &lt;a title=&#34;The Night That Changed My Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-night-that-changed-my-life/&#34;&gt;received a Warrior calling&lt;/a&gt; that brought my life back on track. As I started training my body, and developing emotional and mental strength, I found myself becoming more confident and outgoing. Problems that had overwhelmed me no longer did, and I felt a noticeable increase in my sense of effectiveness. My grades improved, even as I took on more extra-curricular activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A New Path for a Wimpy Kid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up on this, I looked for other areas in which I could cultivate inner strength. After college, I returned to my study of self-defense and systematically improved my people skills. The following year, I set my sights on &lt;a title=&#34;Empty Your Cup: Accepting Ignorance to Learn&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empty-your-cup-accepting-ignorance-to-learn/&#34;&gt;living and working in Korea&lt;/a&gt; to foster the ability to live independantly. I took on the challenges of expanding this blog and &lt;a title=&#34;Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/&#34;&gt;writing a book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All this was done with an eye towards increasing my sense of empowerment and convincing myself that &lt;a title=&#34;Your Mountain is Waiting. Do You Dare Conquer it?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/your-mountain-is-waiting-do-you-dare-conquer-it/&#34;&gt;my dreams were within my grasp&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps more importantly, worth pursuing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result has been a tremendous increase in my strength of purpose and my faith in my ability to effect positive change in the world.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I can&#39;t sleep. My mind whirls around, jumping from one thing to the next, sometimes so fast it scares me and I have to open my eyes to stare at the blackness of my room. Viewing the world in distinct categories, I end up feeling overwhelmed because there is too much to keep track of. When my mind finally relaxes, the artificial distinctions I use to categorize the world dissolve, and it is all revealed to be One.</description>

“The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are.” - Anon
 By the time you read this, I will have landed in Boulder, CO, my new home for the foreseeable future.
That&#39;s a little scary to say now. I only decided to move here 30 days ago.
The road that brought me here was sort of a surprise, like a forest path you don&#39;t see until you&#39;re right on top of it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was doing some research for an article I&#39;m writing on play as exercise, and I needed a photograph of a playground. Of course, that meant I had to test out the playground, which got me thinking on &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Play&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-play/&#34;&gt;how central the playground was in my daily life when I was a kid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Movement as a Rite of Passage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American School of Dubai, where I went to elementary school, had a pretty awesome playground. The front consisted of three corridors of hanging traverse: there was a line of monkey bars flanked on both sides by lines of hanging rings. The rings on the left were short and closely spaced, while those on the right had much larger spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a title=&#34;Your Mountain is Waiting. Do You Dare Conquer it?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/your-mountain-is-waiting-do-you-dare-conquer-it/&#34;&gt;aspiring&lt;/a&gt; to complete the full set on the right side, like all the big kids. Every day, before school, at recess, and after school, I would practice swinging from the rings. Some days I would just do the short rings, to build confidence, but I usually gave the long rings a shot. I would patiently wait my turn in line with the big kids, enduring sneers and ridicule (I don&#39;t honestly remember), until I came to the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart would catch. After waiting in line for agonizing minutes, would I now waste all of that by falling to the sand in &lt;a title=&#34;But What if You Fail?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/but-what-if-you-fail/&#34;&gt;failure&lt;/a&gt; after one measly swing?</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
-Isaiah 2:4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post from Shawn Rhodes, founder of Shoshin Consulting. After growing up in the mountains training in martial arts and eastern philosophy, he followed his own warrior’s calling and joined the U.S. Marines. There, he accompanied infantry Marines through two tours in Iraq, documenting their trials and victories for international news outlets like CNN and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;rhodessmaller&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rhodessmaller-e1358734605767-150x150.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIME. While living and fighting alongside this tribe of modern-day warriors, he discovered the link between the warrior’s path and mastery in life. He returned to the U.S. with the passion to share a vision of what humans are capable of when they embrace their own inner warrior and return to a mindset where all paths are possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the third in a three-part series on The Warrior&#39;s Path. Each installment will explore the evolution of the warrior mindset. Rooted in ancient methods warriors followed for thousands of years, adopting this mindset can help anyone to regain balance, direction, and control of their health, success, and life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/part-i-of-the-warrior-mindset-turn-problems-into-challenges/&#34;&gt;the first part&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I showed readers how past and present-day warriors learn to shift their mindsets, allowing them to transform the problems they face into challenges of responsibility for the quality of their lives. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-warrior-mindset-part-2-transform-challenges-into-opportunities/&#34;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, readers stepped into the mindset of a mature and experienced warrior, a person who is confident in their abilities and no longer feels the need to prove themselves. As a result of this mindset, they see experiences in their lives as opportunities for growth as warriors and human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the next stage in a warrior’s development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, it would be helpful to examine the roles that warriors throughout history have played when they - as a culture - existed in peacetime. It makes sense that skillful warriors would eventually work themselves out of a job by either death or victory. However, the warrior tradition in human cultures has grown to allow for periods of peace. In fact, some of the most skilled warrior societies were based on achieving internal and external peace. Japanese culture, for instance, gave rise to the renowned Samurai.  The word for ‘warrior’ - &lt;i&gt;bushi  &lt;/i&gt;(武士) &lt;i&gt;– &lt;/i&gt;is comprised of symbols for ‘a spear being removed or taken away.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few warriors who experienced and fought in prolonged combat who would choose that lifestyle for themselves and their families. It is a paradox that to achieve peace one must confront war (internally, externally, or both), but it is true. &lt;b&gt;A warriors’ ultimate objective is to bring peace to themselves and their world&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a warrior finds a place of peace, their real challenge begins.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shawn Rhodes, founder of Shoshin Consulting, is a traveler, teacher and above all, a lifelong student. After growing up in the mountains training in martial arts and eastern philosophy, he followed his own warrior&#39;s calling and joined the U.S. Marines. There, he accompanied infantry Marines through two combat tours in Iraq, documenting their trials and victories for international news outlets like CNN and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2723&#34; alt=&#34;rhodessmaller&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rhodessmaller-e1358734605767-150x150.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIME.

Rooted in ancient methods warriors followed for thousands of years, adopting this mindset can help anyone to regain balance, direction, and control of their health, success, and life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/part-i-of-the-warrior-mindset-turn-problems-into-challenges/&#34;&gt;the first part &lt;/a&gt;of this series, readers learned how to use the ancient mindset of the warrior to see life in a new way. Instead of viewing the world as a place that acts upon our lives, we learned everyone has the ability to choose how to process situations. &lt;b&gt;Seeing each problem in life as a challenge to shift our mindset is the first stage of warriorhood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second installment of this series, we will learn the next stage in the evolution of the warrior mindset is &lt;strong&gt;turning those challenges into opportunities, and why it’s the supreme form of power&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people - especially young men - get stuck in the first stage of a warrior’s development. They’ve learned to see the problems in their lives as challenges, but they make a key mistake that freezes their development: they see each challenge as a threat and a test of their strength. We’ve all seen the chest-puffing and rooster dance from two guys at the bar or on the schoolyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Need to Prove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced, after seeing firsthand people spend months trying to kill each other in modern war, that much of the violence in this world comes from people feeling threatened and wanting to protect what they see as ‘theirs‘: their life, their property, their ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks aren’t operating from the mindset of mature warriors; they are approaching their lives like a guard defending a castle, afraid of the walls crumbling at any moment. Without their bravado and one-upmanship, others might discover just how fragile their self-image really is. People frozen in this stage may be extremely skilled fighters, but they rush blindly into battles without examining the playing field for the best - and easiest - ways to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the most famous texts outlining the warrior mindset - The Hagakure - its author Yamamoto Tsunemoto likens a skilled warrior on the battlefield to a hawk taking down a single bird in a flock. Experienced warriors focus their minds on a task - or an opponent - and are unconcerned with the opinions of others in the flock or social circle. &lt;b&gt;Instead, they are more concerned with performance than they are with proving their competence. &lt;/b&gt;This makes them extremely effective at whatever they set their minds to, whether it’s being a fighter or an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are young and still exploring your relationship to your world by comparing your strength against others, the sooner you move past needing to prove yourself, the sooner you can embrace a deeper kind of power.</description>

Each installment will explore the evolution of the warrior mindset.  Rooted in ancient methods warriors followed for thousands of years, these installments will give readers a glimpse into how traditional and modern warriors see the world.  Adopting this mindset can help anyone regain balance, direction, and control of their health, success, and life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional role of the fighter - the person who trains from a young age to be skilled in combat - is disappearing. For better or worse, the mindset learned from a lifetime of turning problems to one’s advantage on the battlefield or the boardroom is being lost. Technology is changing the face of war and our world. The traditional warrior&#39;s path - years of intense physical training, exposure to the elements, mental exhaustion, moments that burn into memory - is not for everyone. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t benefit from the way warriors learn to see themselves and the world, however. I believe this valiant spirit lives inside everyone, and that we can all benefit from learning how to approach the world like a warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A select few still hear the call to embrace warriorhood; not the call to control others with force, but to turn their focus inward to the battlefield of their own lives. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calling is universal to every place and age. As we allow ourselves to become dependent on external distractions to fill our inner voids, the call to seize control of our destinies and live with a courageous spirit is louder than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many of us turn to television, alcohol, drugs, and even chronic exercise in the hope it will distract us from our responsibility as human beings and warriors: the mission of the warrior is to discover all they are capable of being.</description>

      <title>Are You as Fit as Your Dog? 5 Ways to Play Fetch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/?attachment_id=2707&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2707&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2707&#34; alt=&#34;Hard at Play&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3244259451_0120de8a9d.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&#39;ve had a series of intense posts lately, and there are more in the schedule (see below for more on that...and a funny video of me falling in the mud), so here&#39;s a much more lighthearted one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a strong advocate of spontaneous, playful movement as the best way to get exercise. That&#39;s why I love &lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34;&gt;MovNat&#39;s philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. I feel that play is more engaging, gets your mind off the strain of exercising (so you&#39;ll do more), and &lt;a title=&#34;The Communion of Play; A Day of Natural Movement on the River&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-communion-of-play-a-day-of-natural-movement-on-the-river/&#34;&gt;can be shared as social activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&#39;ve been undergoing a self-imposed training program for my &lt;a title=&#34;How to Make a Dream Come True&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-to-make-a-dream-come-true/&#34;&gt;MovNat Trainer Certification&lt;/a&gt;, which has been lonely in the cold winter of New England. This past weekend, I finally got my girlfriend (who will now be referred to as Rocketpack instead of the mysterious, A) to come out with me. Seizing on this opportunity for social play, I came up with a game to make my sprint-esque workout more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played a timeless classic, enjoyed not just by humans, but by our furry friends as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yup, we played fetch.</description>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/?attachment_id=2693&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2693&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-2693&#34; alt=&#34;Achieving Goals Feels Good&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/66728_700953401774_1869754869_n1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;592&#34; height=&#34;396&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&#39;t very often that we get to cross out a big goal in our lives, but that is exactly what I did at the end of November. I&#39;d been dreaming of &lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34;&gt;becoming a MovNat trainer&lt;/a&gt; since I heard about the method in 2009. Around April of last year, when MovNat announced they were offering trainer certifications, I finally decided to make this dream a reality. I couldn&#39;t afford the certification with what I was making as an ESL teacher; I would have to raise the money by &lt;a title=&#34;Lessons Learned on Finishing My First Book&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-on-finishing-my-first-book/&#34;&gt;writing and promoting&lt;/a&gt; an eBook, which I published in September of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By November of 2012, I had raised enough from donations for the eBook (as well as a few t-shirt sales) to sign up for my MovNat trainer certification in March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long road to get there, but the most valuable thing I got out of the whole experience won&#39;t be the MCT certification itself. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, it is the confidence that I can affect my life without permission from anyone else&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Things That Matter</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-things-that-matter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-things-that-matter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-things-that-matter/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2674&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-2674&#34; title=&#34;A moment of pure bliss&#34; alt=&#34;Two dogs and a glass of wine&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a way to live responsibly. Knowing all the suffering and pollution caused by industrial farming and how that impacted my health, I made the commitment to eating organic and supporting local food whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify my decision-making, I made up all sorts of rules about what I could and couldn&#39;t eat. Soon, adhering to the rules became more important than what the rules were meant to help me accomplish, which was eating in harmony. This harmonious way of eating would naturally give rise to health, but when I ran into the Paleo and Primal communities, health itself took the top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the obsession over good vs. bad carbs, optimal post-workout nutrition, and coconut substitutions for everything, I realized my diet had become meaningless. By all accounts, I ate well. My food was high quality and nutritious, but all this was lost on me. &lt;strong&gt;I didn&#39;t even taste my meals anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&#39;t know how common this is among Paleo eaters and I hope you will leave comments sharing your experiences. It seems to me that obsessing over the health aspects of Paleo (dangerously easy to do given the mindset of the community) could lead us to forget how to enjoy our food for its own sake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventually, I came to believe that &lt;a title=&#34;You Can’t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-cant-afford-to-be-attached-to-your-health-so-make-it-about-others/&#34;&gt;my health doesn&#39;t matter&lt;/a&gt;, per se. I didn&#39;t live to be healthy. I was healthy in order to live well. &lt;/strong&gt;How I ate needed to be a reflection of that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear.&#34; - His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I realized that, I stopped getting so upset with the dietary rules. Eventually, I was able to reconnect with the enjoyment of my food again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, as you get deeper into Paleo, you realize that optimal health requires eating and living sustainably. So, even if your main priority is health, you are forced to aim higher, to prioritize something more general, in order to achieve that. The reality forces a widening of your concerns. If you refuse to see this, you end up chasing your own tail in a never-ended spiral of healthy living.</description>

      <description>That&#39;s me hanging on the ledge in the middle of the photo.
I will always remember the night I willingly lowered myself into an ice bath as the day I went over the edge and became certifiably weird. Crazy might be a better term for it.
Healthy behavior can seem unusual when viewed from the perspective of the mainstream. After all, the very fact that some behavior stands out as &#34;</description>

      <title>Forget the Resolution! Set a Challenge!</title>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/forget-the-resolution-set-a-challenge/418636_674776395704_416458635_n1/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2646&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-2646 aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;418636_674776395704_416458635_n(1)&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/418636_674776395704_416458635_n1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;581&#34; height=&#34;389&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Resolutions are boring. I resolve to behave better this year, blah, blah, blah... This is a whole new &lt;em&gt;YEAR &lt;/em&gt;we&#39;re talking about, not just the turn of an hourglass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s so great about a resolution anyway? Sure, it&#39;s an opportunity to start anew, to take a stab at &lt;a title=&#34;You’re Not Broken, So You Can’t “Fix” Yourself&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/youre-not-broken-so-you-cant-fix-yourself/&#34;&gt;fixing something that you think is broken&lt;/a&gt; about yourself, to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we want to be better? Is it just to feel good about ourselves? Or are we &lt;a title=&#34;You Can’t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-cant-afford-to-be-attached-to-your-health-so-make-it-about-others/&#34;&gt;trying to accomplish something greater&lt;/a&gt; in our lives than self-satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to lose weight, or gain muscle, or workout more, or write more, or become financially independent, or eat more local food, or get a promotion, or learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All attainable goals, great things for anyone to do. Which is fine. If you are aiming for mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we need - what &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;need - is something epic, something grand, something game-changing, something that matters to you specifically, something for which you in particular were destined.&lt;/strong&gt; Your bliss, to use the terminology of Joseph Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you follow your bliss... doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors; and where there wouldn&#39;t be a door for anyone else. - Joseph Campbell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&#39;t need another resolution. You need a challenge.</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Feminine Mystique</title>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/book-review-the-feminine-mystique/</guid>
      <description>One of my biggest reading projects these past few months has been Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique. I’ve always been interested in women’s psychology and feminism, so I was eager to deepen my understanding by reading this canonical work.
It’s a very, very long and very convoluted book (the nature of the problem seems to ensure this, since Second Sex was equally difficult), but here’s a quick overview.
The Mystique Friedan addresses the state of women during the 40s, 50s, and 60s, into the 70s, when many women gave up on pursuing an education and a career, denying all their aspirations but those related to raising a family.</description>

      <title>Happy Holidays from Warrior Spirit</title>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/happy-holidays-from-warrior-spirit-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2624&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;224&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/happy-holidays-from-warrior-spirit-2/img_0001/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2624&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2624&#34; alt=&#34;Christmas at our house is a pretty small affair&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0001-224x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;224&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christmas at our house is a pretty small affair[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the holidays at the end of the year are my time for reflection and spiritual recuperation after a long year full of activity and constant growth. This year in particular was especially exhilarating. The work that went into &lt;a title=&#34;Lessons Learned on Finishing My First Book&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-on-finishing-my-first-book/&#34;&gt;writing my book&lt;/a&gt; and promoting it while teaching English in Korea was extremely taxing emotionally and mentally, and when it was done, I found it difficult to keep up that pace of work (hence the drop off in social media and general writing activity). There was never really a chance to rest, since A and I were still working and traveling: we visited Jeju Island, flew back to the States for a wedding, visited the DMZ, did a three day templestay, and went on a whirlwind tour of the Middle East (more on those things to come).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these activities did involve some physical work, they were most taxing mentally. We were always on the run, always desperate for a good night&#39;s sleep, living a largely nomadic existence, constantly working under looming deadlines, worried about missing buses, trains, planes. It was intense, and the demands of &lt;a title=&#34;Keeping it Together; The Importance of Good Life Posture&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/keeping-it-together-the-importance-of-good-life-posture/&#34;&gt;maintaining proper life posture&lt;/a&gt; became much more difficult under the constantly shifting circumstances. We were on our own most of the time, reliant on our own resources and disconnected from our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve been looking forward to this quiet holiday season for several months.</description>

      <title>The Myth of Control in (Paleo) Health</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-myth-of-control-in-paleo-health/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-myth-of-control-in-paleo-health/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“The closest to being in control we will ever be is in that moment that we realize we&#39;re not.” - Brian Kessler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/?attachment_id=2611&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2611&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2611&#34; alt=&#34;LettingGo&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/LettingGo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;333&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last year, my&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/in-memory-of-auntie-phyllis/&#34;&gt; Aunt Phyllis&lt;/a&gt; succumbed to leukemia. I have often wondered if a change in diet could have improved her quality of life, given her more time, or even reversed the disease, based on anecdotes from  the Paleo community. Uncertainty kept me silent. Would it have made things better, or just given her more to worry about? Would I be trivializing her disease or the advice of her doctors? Would it mean I was &lt;i&gt;blaming&lt;/i&gt; her for the leukemia or its progression, by attributing the disease to lifestyle choices? Would it have made her feel ashamed that she had cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, the suggestion that we can directly impact our health, even influencing such big-name diseases as cancer, diabetes, alzhiemer’s, and MS, is unwelcome. &lt;b&gt;It implies that our suffering is our fault, and can lead to a sense of guilt or shame.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if health is a critical factor in our ability to positively impact the world, it is not the final determinant of a person’s worth. Better to judge a person by what they have contributed to the lives of others and how they have made the world a better place. This may seem obvious, but in practice, many of us forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, someone else close to me has been diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening condition. Given my knowledge and experience, I&#39;m not sure how to help, or even if I should help at all. How we live if up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons Learned from a Year Living and Working in Korea</title>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;My year in Korea has come to its end. Friday was my last teaching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have done in the past, I like to look back as this chapter of my life comes to a close and review what I&#39;ve learned. Putting the experiences into a larger context helps me learn from my mistakes and consolidate my successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in my first year of living completely independent of my parents, in a country that is literally on the other side of the world from my hometown. Here is what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since Joseph Campbell writes about the hero&#39;s journey, I thought he would be especially appropriate to help illustrate reflection on this rite of passage. So, this is a Campbell-themed post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the States. Since I am an American, for better or worse, I do celebrate this holiday. After all, it celebrates a brief moment in US history when we had the sense to appreciate the kindness shown by the Native Americans, without whose generosity and hospitality, we would have starved to death in a frigid New England winter. The pilgrims needed food, and the local people helped them out.</description>

      <title>The Communion of Play; A Day of Natural Movement on the River</title>

      <description>Last month, I spent a day enjoying a river park that runs past my home in Korea. While the exercise itself was freeing, what really struck me was how simply being playful and exercising like this seemed to connect with other people, even those I couldn&#39;t communicate with. The natural, playful movement intrigued people, brought them joy, even inspired some of them to try it themselves. It was as if seeing an &#39;adult&#39; playing let them believe it was okay for them to engage with their own bodies in ways they normally left to their kids.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a computer gets old and starts to slow down, we know it is time to buy a new one. Computers can&#39;t grow, learn, or adapt, so once they have outlived their usefulness, developed too many bugs, or are simply broken, we scrap them. This makes sense because a computer performs a specific function, and if it can&#39;t do that, it is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment if we treated humans like that. Wouldn&#39;t it be stupid if we just gave up on people or ourselves because of one or two bugs that tripped them up every now and then? Totally ridiculous, right? People, after all, grow and adapt. We can learn, and even if we are slow to learn, we can make adjustments for our weaknesses in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/3774175_73285f84a9.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2540&#34; title=&#34;Baby Jane&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3774175_73285f84a9-300x212.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;212&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet, many people view themselves through the same standards they assess their computers, cars, and refrigerators.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, you can&#39;t just go out and buy a new psych, so what course of action is called for when you believe you are non-functional?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we view life and ourselves determines how successful we will be in dealing with its challenges, and choosing to view ourselves through this particular lens does more harm than good.</description>

      <title>Keeping it Together; The Importance of Good Life Posture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cell sits dark and dank, but tidy, waiting patiently for its occupant to return. With a clang, the door slams open and two burly guards throw a scarecrow of a man onto the floor, fresh out of torture. They stand at the door a moment, sniggering while he picks himself up and hobbles to the small washbasin, where he carefully starts to clean the blood off his face.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/7304451284_aa7892d4a9.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2521&#34; title=&#34;Good Posture&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7304451284_aa7892d4a9-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;Why does he waste his time?&#34; one guard asks the other. &#34;They&#39;ll just mess him up again in a few hours.&#34; The other guard just laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prisoner ignores them. When they leave, he removes his torn prison uniform, folds it carefully and sets it at the foot of his bed. Then, he tends to his wounds. All he wants is to throw himself onto his bed, curl up and blank out everything, but he makes the effort to respect himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, he feels his sanity returning as he goes through the familiar motions. He feels his sense of value returning and he breathes deeply, enjoying the simple pleasure of moving his muscles and tending to his needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does this every day, and has for the last eight years of torture. Fastidiously looking after his health and the tidiness of his environment, despite what to any other would justify letting go, he has held on to his sanity. By going through the motions of cleanliness, he is telling his mind that his life has not fallen apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for eight years, no torture has broken him, because he lets nothing that has happened be enough of an emergency to disrupt his routine, and thus, his integrity.</description>

      <title>Love is Like Having a Cat...and a Temporary Goodbye</title>

One of the problems with being my age is that I forget how inexperienced I am and how much I have to learn about myself and life in general. I sometimes trick myself into thinking I can do anything and everything. I am wrong, but I still persist, sometimes to my detriment and that of others around me. Nowhere is that truth driven home more forcefully than in relationships and the delicate dance that is loving another person.</description>

      <title>You&#39;re Not the One Who Will Achieve Your Dreams</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/youre-not-the-one-who-will-achieve-your-dreams/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“The recipe for perpetual ignorance is: Be satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge.” -Elbert Hubbard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know what we are, but know now what we may be.” - William Shakespeare&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6527715119_b568570ab2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2499&#34; title=&#34;The Illusion of the Self&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6527715119_b568570ab2-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest obstacles to accomplishing our greatest dreams and goals is the fear of growth. We are unwilling to change, even in a positive way, because growth is painful. Even when we get stronger as a result, we tend to shy away from the necessary discomfort that comes with the process of improving ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After all, growth only comes as the result of learning to deal with challenges that are slightly beyond us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is that,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in order to accomplish our goals, we must grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we didn&#39;t need to grow, we would already be doing what we dream about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on our particular dream, the kind of change and growth we need will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to get stronger, faster, healthier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to make more connections and meet more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to gain deeper insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to learn new ideas and master new theories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to see the world in a slightly different way that empowers us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to play a bigger game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to be comfortable with the things that scare us at the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, that last one covers all the others, and it is significant because it is integral to our sense of who we are. &lt;strong&gt;Our fears create our limiting image of ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>Trusting My Inner Compass</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/trusting-my-inner-compass/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Intuition is the supra-logic that cuts out all the routine processes of thought and leaps straight from the problem to the answer. - Robert Graves&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1806225034_3692692a61.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-2488&#34; title=&#34;Moral Compass&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1806225034_3692692a61.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am applying to graduate school for the next year. Based on my interests and plans, a masters in ecopsychology being offered at the Buddhist-inspired Naropa University seemed like the perfect fit. I&#39;ve been disillusioned by Western education, have been profoundly affected by Buddhist psychology, and believe that the best way to impact people&#39;s ecological behavior is by appealing to the way they perceive the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecopsychology is an emerging field, however, and more than a few people have expressed concerns over my decision. My girlfriend cautioned me to think how a degree in &#34;ecopsychology&#34; from a &#34;Buddhist university&#34; would affect my credibility as a writer and thinker. My best friend, more direct and less tactful, called it quackery and was worried that I was throwing away a lot of money. Surprisingly, my parents haven&#39;t expressed such concerns. They are normally the ones to reign me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, because I value the opinions of those close to me, I evaluated my options and ended up paralyzed by second-guessing.</description>

      <title>How Far do You Take Paleo?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-far-do-you-take-paleo/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-far-do-you-take-paleo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Tell me the place you were born, the lives your ancestors led/&lt;br /&gt;
The ground that surrounded the people you love, the streams from which you were fed/&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s the wind that carries the seed, and the seed that carries the song/&lt;br /&gt;
The food that we&#39;re eating is rooted in soil, and it&#39;s soil that is keeping us strong/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Libby Roderick, &#34;Low to the Ground&#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/3736382830_a6cb6c31ed.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2473&#34; title=&#34;Hunters&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3736382830_a6cb6c31ed-300x175.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;175&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you draw the line in Paleo? Is it just a diet fad your gym is following, or do you place a higher importance on healthy eating? Do you keep The Paleo in the kitchen, or does it encompass all health behavior? If it is about health, is it restricted to your personal health, or does it encompass the health of your community? Is it more than just a set of health habits, but a lifestyle and a philosophy of living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, Paleo only goes as far as practical. They eat the bacon avocado salads, are quick to find recipes for Paleo-pancakes and are happy to be only as strict their tastes allow. Paleo is confined to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many more, following the principles of Paleo extends a little beyond convenience and diet. These people are willing to endure inconvenience because Paleo isn’t just a fashionable diet that happens to work. Paleo is about their health. They make an effort to eliminate stress, get enough sleep, and go out of their way to find grassfed meat and locally grown vegetables. Paleo extends to the way they exercise and move, keeping things spontaneous, playful, and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people push Paleo even further (but not many). They allow Paleo to seep out of their ‘health and fitness’ lives. When it does, Paleo starts to become a lifestyle instead of a diet-and-exercise program. It stops fitting in that convenient compartment we have scheduled for an hour in the morning and after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a funny thing starts to happen when you let Paleo expand beyond the bounds set by social convenience. &lt;strong&gt;It starts to define it’s own rules of social convenience. It starts to change the way we see the world, instead of itself being limited by the world&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Start with Why</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/book-review-start-with-why/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/book-review-start-with-why/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with Why &lt;/em&gt;is a book that will change how you see everything, including the way you relate to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, Simon Sinek, claims to reveal the secret that lets great leaders inspire others, and which, if ignored, leaves even the most well-equipped organizations sounding hollow and insincere, short-circuiting any attempts to inspire loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That secret is simple: all great leaders and organizations that inspire us start with WHY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything they do expresses their reason for existence. Instead of telling the world WHAT they do, great leaders consider their WHATs almost incidental to their purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#39;s refrain: People don&#39;t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a simple concept, but a very arresting one. Sinek explains the &lt;a title=&#34;The Golden Circle&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-golden-circle/&#34;&gt;Golden Circle&lt;/a&gt;, his model for explaining the relationship between WHY, HOW, and WHAT (read my &lt;a title=&#34;The Golden Circle&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-golden-circle/&#34;&gt;previous post &lt;/a&gt;for details). Most of the really important ideas can be gleaned from the &lt;a title=&#34;Sinek TED talk&#34; href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/view/lang/en//id/848&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;famous TED talk&lt;/a&gt;. The book, however, does offer the kind of in-depth elaboration that is the hallmark of long-form writing. Sinek works out all the kinks and applies the model to a variety of situations, ranging from individuals to business organizations, to entire cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of businesses, Sinek&#39;s principles have some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When companies focus too strongly on WHAT they do, they get bogged down in fierce competition over product features and pricing, often resorting to manipulations--promotions, sales gimmicks, rebates--in order to drive sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that are able to express their WHY, on the other hand, don&#39;t even need to compete, as long as they have a decent product. Anyone who is familiar with the cult-like loyalty of Apple&#39;s followers can attest to the fact that people who buy Apple products don&#39;t even consider the competition. This is because Apple doesn&#39;t sell computers, according to Sinek. Instead, they champion individuality and non-conformity. They just happen to sell computers. And MP3 players. And phones. And tablets. And music. And movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, finding your WHY can make a seemingly wide array of WHATs serve a coherent, unified identity.</description>

      <title>Guilt by Association; Chained to the Wrong Job</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;There Is A Voice Inside Of You&lt;br /&gt;
That Whispers All Day Long,&lt;br /&gt;
&#34;I Feel That This Is Right For Me,&lt;br /&gt;
I Know That This Is Wrong.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
No Teacher, Preacher, Parent, Friend&lt;br /&gt;
Or Wise Man Can Decide&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s Right For You- Just Listen To&lt;br /&gt;
The Voice That Speaks Inside.&#34; - Shel Silverstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/7550109580_08554ef572.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2454&#34; title=&#34;Chained to your job&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7550109580_08554ef572-247x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;247&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, my employer did something that got me really angry. I&#39;m not going to go into details, because even though she doesn&#39;t read English and I wouldn&#39;t mind that much if I got fired at this point, it would still be kind of underhanded to do it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, today&#39;s events did teach me a very important lesson about integrity: When I work for someone, a group, or a company, I need to make sure their values are in line with my own, otherwise I risk putting my efforts and energy into causes that I either don&#39;t care about, or that I am totally opposed to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work for an organization, your efforts are directed towards achieving that organization&#39;s ends. Sometimes, this is great. With the multiplier effect of a dedicated community, your small contribution can have much larger effects than it otherwise would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you don&#39;t agree with what your organization is doing, then your energy is applied to something you would otherwise oppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is why &lt;a title=&#34;The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/&#34;&gt;Awareness &lt;/a&gt;is extremely important in ensuring that you live the life you want. If you don&#39;t pay attention to the implications of your actions, then you end up being taken for a ride.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a WS Blog Post</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/anatomy-of-a-ws-blog-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/anatomy-of-a-ws-blog-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go.” E.L. Doctorow&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3397858623_ff8e4ce060.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2445&#34; title=&#34;Anatomy of a Blogger&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3397858623_ff8e4ce060.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;322&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old writing teacher once told me it&#39;s better to be wordy and get the point across than try to cater to short attention spans and leave everyone scratching their heads. I learned in high school that if you write an engaging story, people will read 20 page sci-fi action adventures, long for high school creative writing. If you make it appeal to their emotions, they will even enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing goes for blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a writer with a blog, I want to make sure every post I write is engaging and inspiring. Learning how to write in this medium has been a long and arduous process. I am still refining it, but in recent months, I&#39;ve had a bit of success reaching new readers, so I wanted to share my current working template of my blog posts. Not all of them match this, of course (this one doesn&#39;t), but it serves as a loose framework to aim for.  It largely depends on how much time I have and how much energy I have after chasing &lt;del&gt;psychotic&lt;/del&gt; energetic Korean children around all day.</description>

      <title>Tell a Story, Change the World</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/tell-a-story-change-the-world/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/5989736193_952566e542.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2436&#34; title=&#34;Storytelling&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5989736193_952566e542-300x204.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;204&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Storytelling is the most powerful way to put ideas into the world today. - Robert McAfee Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create a better reality, first tell as story about it so real and compelling that all uncertainty and fear is replaced by excitement and a desire for something better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are funny sometimes. Even when we want something better than what we have, we are reluctant to move towards it until we are assured it is safe. Most people will always prefer the known reality they have over the unknown they might have, even if could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainty is a huge demotivator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was starting to change my life for the better, the biggest obstacle to progress was the inability to see the reality I wanted to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how much I pushed myself to meet people, I could not see myself as socially confident, and so I never became comfortable with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how many pushups I did, I never saw myself as strong, and so they were always hard and my progress was painfully slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how much I wrote, I never saw myself as a writer, and so I had only marginal success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventually, I realized the problem wasn&#39;t my lack of practice. It was the fact that I was clinging to the wrong picture of who I was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of focusing on the logistics, I started to focus on the image in my head, the vision I had of what and who I was. I started to imagine myself doing all the great things I was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagined every detail of the me who was socially confident and engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I painted a detailed image of a strong, muscular, fast, athletic me, doing all the cool things I wanted to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I called myself a writer, over and over, and talked as if that was how I made my living.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when my mind became comfortable with the image, my reality started to conform to it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2427&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2075441844_b3a8ed26a0.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2427&#34; title=&#34;Steadfast Rocks&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2075441844_b3a8ed26a0-300x201.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;201&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sometimes you aren&#39;t supposed to go with the flow[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important principles may and must be inflexible. -Abraham Lincoln&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to explain why I decided to go back to giving away my book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/&#34;&gt;The Warrior Spirit Principles of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for free or a donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I had been reading Simon Sinek&#39;s book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Golden Circle&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-golden-circle/&#34;&gt;Start with Why&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which explains that leaders inspire because they lead with WHY they do things, as opposed to WHAT they do. Even if they do ineffective things, they are driven by a purpose, and that comes across in all their actions. They maintain integrity, behaving in accordance with their principles, rather than convenience. The result is that we follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of great leaders in history. Not everything they did was the best course of action for every situation, but they were always people of integrity, so we forgave them, believed they had the right purpose, and gave them our loyalty anyway. One of my personal role models, Franklin D. Roosevelt, led the United States through a morally complicated war. There were certainly a great number of poor decisions made by him and his administration, but he had a clear purpose, and everything he did was somehow connected to that purpose. So, for the most part, he had the country&#39;s loyalty and he is remembered as a great leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, after I finished my book, I realized that charging $10 for it did not mesh with WHY I&#39;d written the book in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote it because I believe that everyone should &lt;a title=&#34;A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/&#34;&gt;know as much as possible &lt;/a&gt;about their health and be fully empowered to &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34;&gt;cultivate their bodies&lt;/a&gt;. I also firmly believe that this is a natural right of being human. It&#39;s not something that should be withheld or taken advantage of. I wrote the book to &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; what I know with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finished &lt;em&gt;Start with Why, &lt;/em&gt;I applied the ideas to my own projects, and it became clear that if my purpose was free and open sharing of my experiences, I couldn&#39;t justify charging money for it. Even if my book was worth money by societal standard, that&#39;s not why I wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, why did I decide to sell it in the first place?</description>

      <title>Review of Gold Medal Bodies Floor 1 Training Program</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/review-of-gold-medal-bodies-floor-1-training-program/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/review-of-gold-medal-bodies-floor-1-training-program/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Floor-One_small.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2422&#34; title=&#34;Floor-One_small&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Floor-One_small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;351&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have always been inspired by gymnasts, who seem to defy gravity. When I started strengthening my own body, the first methods I used were based on gymnastics bodyweight movements: handstand pushups, pistol squats, jumps, dives, rolls, and pullups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was always difficult to program a good bodyweight routine, and I spent years making progress then stalling, revising my approach, moving forward, stalling, etc. Most resources assume that if you&#39;re going to use the same movements as gymnasts, you must train as intensely as gymnasts, regardless of your goals. The programs were either too demanding, required too much time, or were absurdly complicated. It was a frustrating process, and the simplicity of barbell training was very tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I found &lt;a title=&#34;Gold Medal Bodies&#34; href=&#34;http://www.goldmedalbodies.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gold Medal Bodies&lt;/a&gt;, I got really excited. They specifically addressed the fact that, while gymnasts take these training methods to extremes for their sport, the movements and programs themselves don&#39;t need to be so difficult for the average person. In fact, Gold Medal Bodies (GMB) emphasized that they don&#39;t provide gymnastic training but rather draw from gymnastics (as well as yoga and martial arts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their attitude towards training also mirrored my own: useful, holistic, comprehensive, not self-destructive, and fun. They really stress &lt;a title=&#34;Integrity of Movement, and My First RKC Class&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/integrity-of-movement-and-my-first-rkc-class/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;integrity of movement &lt;/a&gt;and body control, and consolidating strength exercises into applicable skills. Generally, I think they are one of the best things to happen to training. I downloaded their free handstand tutorial and in 1 week found myself finally getting a solid handstand, after 3 years of shaky results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was determined to try out GMB&#39;s main training programs, and after mentioning it in my book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, they offered me my choice of program, so here is the review after my first two weeks.</description>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2405&#34; title=&#34;A Helping Hand&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o-e1347370123178-300x223.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some people choose not to donate their services because they believe that it somehow devalues them by &#34;giving them away.&#34; In truth, there is nothing that demonstrates the value of your skills more than putting them to good use for a cause you believe in. - Scott Allen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in good shape can be dangerous. It can be very easy to slip into feelings of superiority: “I’m stronger than others. I take better care of myself. I look sexier than most people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is the worst thing in the world, but when I caught myself sneaking too many glances in the mirror and comparing myself to others at my gym, I started to feel that perhaps my &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34;&gt;priorities&lt;/a&gt; were out of line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, when I was particularly annoyed with my pride, I remembered the story of the Siddhartha Guatama. Siddhartha was a prince who grew up sheltered from suffering but who one day witnessed sickness and death and realized that all his princely luxury, his youth, and his health would fall away. He began to question whether all that he had would truly spare him from suffering or make the world a better place. He gave it all away to seek spiritual enlightenment, eventually achieving &lt;em&gt;nirvana&lt;/em&gt; as the historical Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I realized that, proud as I am of my strong, attractive body, it will one day succumb to death&lt;/strong&gt;. At best, I would remain strong and vital until my twilight years, free of chronic disease, then die suddenly and peacefully. As a believer in the &lt;a title=&#34;The Optimism of Ancestral Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-optimism-of-ancestral-health/&#34;&gt;inherent integrity&lt;/a&gt; of the human body, I see this as a distinct possibility. At worst, I’ll succumb to the diseases of aging, watch my strength wither away, and suffer a long, slow decline. &lt;strong&gt;No matter what, I end up being totally useless and utterly repulsive: dead and rotting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of my sense of self-worth was attached to something as impermanent as my health or appearance, my pride was clearly ill-founded. &lt;strong&gt;These things will disappear, so my self-worth and happiness will suffer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body, strength, youth, and vitality I worked so hard to attain will inevitably one day fall away from me. In full acceptance of that truth, I had to find a compelling reason to take care of my health regardless.</description>

      <title>The Optimism of Ancestral Health</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-optimism-of-ancestral-health/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-optimism-of-ancestral-health/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/7478267850_38dff958ff.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2396&#34; title=&#34;Optimistic Flower&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7478267850_38dff958ff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;334&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else. - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans break down. This is an accepted truth. Eventually (all too soon), we lose function. We become decrepit, slow, weak, riddled with pain, and ugly. Instead of crystallizing our wisdom &lt;a title=&#34;Aging Gloriously&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/aging-gloriously/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;, our minds decay. Injuries do not heal, at least not without external intervention, and the greatest triumph of humankind is the medical and pharmaceutical industries that graciously prolong our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the mainstream view on the human body. Athletes are exceptional (they get their own label, after all), a healthy lifestyle requires a specifying adjective, &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;isn&#39;t even that healthy&lt;/a&gt;, and sickness is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with the view of the Ancestral Health communities. &lt;strong&gt;We believe that a human being, in its pristine state, is a force to be reckoned with, a marvel of biological engineering, ecological integrity, and spiritual subtlety.&lt;/strong&gt; We heal ourselves, not via magic or superfoods, but because healing is what a healthy body does, and we&#39;ve done everything in our power to remove the obstacles to being normal, which is to say, ridiculously, vibrantly, off-the-wall healthy. Fitness is not even a sufficient term to encompass &lt;a title=&#34;A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what we meant&lt;/a&gt; by movement/&lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Play&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-play/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;/physically expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those in the Ancestral Health communities--Paleo, &lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MovNat&lt;/a&gt;, Primal, Weston A. Price, barefoot runners--there is a belief in the inherent durability and resilience of the human being. Not only can it move and survive without reliance on extensive protection, but it can actually thrive without such crutches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t speak for everyone; there is a fair amount of division, &lt;a title=&#34;Why I Left Paleo Behind, and Why I’m Returning&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-i-left-paleo-behind-and-why-im-returning/&#34;&gt;which led me to wander alone for a while&lt;/a&gt;. But it is safe to say there are many who see these ideas as a path to something greater than a simple advantage in the rat-race.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2384&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/523903_867106689110_2023854343_n.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2384&#34; title=&#34;The First Printout of the Book&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/523903_867106689110_2023854343_n-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The book hardcopy for proofing[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Writing a book is an adventure. To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement; then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes a master, and then a tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster, and fling him out to the public.” - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is published, people have downloaded and read it, and there&#39;s even &lt;a title=&#34;Patrick Garner&#39;s Review&#34; href=&#34;http://patrickgarner.tumblr.com/post/30796756323/book-review-warrior-spirit-principles-for-holistic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; out already. It has been better received than I dared imagine, and it marks the accomplishment of a huge step in my quest to overcome a deep-seated, paralyzing introversion; not just writing something long, but having the courage to put it out into the world.</description>

      <title>Why I Left Paleo Behind, and Why I&#39;m Returning</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/3234878244_e7e5dbef88.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2338&#34; title=&#34;Walking Away&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3234878244_e7e5dbef88-199x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They are asking us to pay more for less shoe, calling it a &#39;barefoot&#39; shoe, and we are happily handing over the money! -- Bryant Rolfe, to me, on a trail run with our new $100 Merrell Trailgloves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got into Paleo, I came through Mark Sisson&#39;s Primal Blueprint. The MDA community was never exclusively about diet, but focused on a &lt;em&gt;lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; of health, vitality, and playfulness. Sure it was a bit tongue-in-cheek and insular, but it was a community with plenty of room for whatever your views might be. There were the hardcore, live-in-the-woods-naked eco-warriors, and there were those who simply wanted to sneak their Vibrams into their cubicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I thought I ought to grow up and go Paleo. Primal seemed like a softer version of the real deal. I attended a Whole9 workshop at my CrossFit box. It didn&#39;t entirely mesh with what I knew about nutrition at the time from my study of Weston A. Price principles and the Primal Blueprint, but I signed on (since then, our beliefs about nutrition have come closer together). As my whole box went into it together, I was swept into the world of Paleo eating and CrossFit exercise, &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34;&gt;two movements totally divorced from a holistic view on life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;m sure the blame lies in how I implemented things, not in the methods themselves, but the way I saw the methods being presented, it didn&#39;t seem like there was much leeway. The segment of the community I was in, which I took to represent all of it, was decidedly narrow-minded.</description>

      <title>Be Like a River: Live with Intention</title>

You can divert it, but it will always find a way to continue its journey downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we were like rivers, and moving towards our goals in life was natural and inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third part of Warrior Spirit is Intention: living with directed focus towards a vision of how you want your life, your self, or your world to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-meaning-of-integrity-the-complete-human/&#34;&gt;Integrity &lt;/a&gt;gives us the purpose. We have values and integrity ensures that those values actually matter to us and define who we are. Integrity allows us to live in accordance with our values, and to honestly care about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/&#34;&gt;Awareness &lt;/a&gt;lets us see how our values play out in the world. It lets us understand the impact of our actions and our life. It is compassion for the world. Awareness is accepting what consequences we create, not hiding from the implications of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intention is the essential third point of the triangle that gives it direction. Intention is what allows us to take action on our values and to do something with what our awareness reveals. It is turning belief into action. It is turning dreams into reality.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;People don&#39;t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. - Simon Sinek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did the Wright Brothers, with no outside funding, no formal education, and no credentials in aviation, manage to build the first airplane before Samuel Pierpont Langley, who was supported by the War Department and followed by the New York Times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More significantly, how can you and I replicate that kind of inspired innovation in our own lives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Simon Sinek&#34; href=&#34;http://www.startwithwhy.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simon Sinek&lt;/a&gt;, inspiration coach and author of &lt;em&gt;Start with Why,&lt;/em&gt; claims to have the answer, and it is a very simple concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to Sinek, there is a fundamental difference between how inspiring leaders see the world and how everyone else does.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason most endeavors fail to inspire is because they try to engage us by telling us WHAT they do, rather than WHY they do it. Sinek demonstrates this with a model he calls the Golden Circle, which is actually three circles nested within one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2314&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/The-Golden-Circle-e1345529413208.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2314&#34; title=&#34;The Golden Circle&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/The-Golden-Circle-e1345529413208-300x231.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;231&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The golden circle[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center is a small circle labelled WHY. The middle circle is HOW, and the outermost circle is WHAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you do it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do you do it? (And why should anyone care?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything we do is motivated by the WHY&lt;/strong&gt;, but we don&#39;t usually communicate that. We may not even be aware of why we behave the way we do. This is because the part of the brain that controls motivation and decision-making, the limbic brain, is one of the most primitive and has no capacity for language. We have difficulty articulating our motivation or why they should care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sinek points out, this fails to inspire action, purchases, or loyalty.</description>

      <title>Integrity of Movement, and My First RKC Class</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/integrity-of-movement-and-my-first-rkc-class/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7400969208_010890b9c21.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-2231&#34; title=&#34;Cheetah Run&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7400969208_010890b9c21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Like a graceful vase, a cat, even when motionless, seems to flow.” - George F. Will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always espoused the importance of &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34;&gt;good quality movement&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn&#39;t until I attended my first RKC Kettlebell class that I got to experience how Integrity of Movement can be taught and conveyed through a comprehensive program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RKC class, which stands for Russian Kettlebell Certification, was taught completely in Korean (because I live in Korea right now), but that wasn&#39;t a huge problem because the coaches were so well-versed in observing and correcting body-mechanics. They had a huge arsenal of tactile cues and could spot an anterior-tilted pelvis across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute class focused on just one movement: the kettlebell swing. For those who have done it, it seems like a fairly simple movement: just swing the kettlebell, using your hips, and keep your back straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;d been teaching kettlebell swings the way I was taught at my CrossFit Level 1 cert for two years. I&#39;ve been doing them regularly for about four years. I had seen all sorts of variations, and I thought I had it down. I was very, very wrong.</description>

      <title>Your Mountain is Waiting. Do You Dare Conquer it?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/164348283_bb687e7e4b_z.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2202&#34; title=&#34;Your Mountain&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/164348283_bb687e7e4b_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won&#39;t lag behind, because you&#39;ll have the speed.&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ll pass the whole gang and you&#39;ll soon take the lead.&lt;br /&gt;
Wherever you fly, you&#39;ll be the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dr. Seuss, &lt;em&gt;Oh the Places You&#39;ll Go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s make things really easy for you. After all, you&#39;re only human. Be happy with what you can do and don&#39;t expect too much of yourself. You want to write? Well, don&#39;t hold yourself to a writing a bestseller. That&#39;s too hard. Settle for just finishing a book. Or, you know what, why not just write a blog? That&#39;s doable. Then you don&#39;t have to worry about failing. World-shattering success is too chancy, and if you&#39;re just not destined for it, why waste your time and go through all that anguish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope the sarcasm in that last paragraph was overwhelmingly, sickeningly obvious.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#39;s greatest athletes have just gathered in London at the Olympics to showcase the very best of what humanity has to offer in terms of physical prowess. We love watching them perform, but rarely do any of us entertain the notion that we could aspire to gold medal success in any aspect of life. We&#39;re happy, even encouraged, to aim for something modest, lest we disappoint ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After all, to reach far is to risk all, and the fall from the top is a lot farther.</description>

      <title>But What if You Fail?</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I was obsessed with D&amp;amp;D. I spent hours on it, and I once created a very elaborate description of a world born of my imagination. At the time, it was the longest thing I&#39;d ever written, about 40 pages. This was a big deal for an aspiring writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I opened my computer and the document was gone. I was simply left with 40 pages of garbled text symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was defeated and considered just forgetting it had ever existed. It had taken so much work, and I felt that if something that big could be destroyed so easily, what was the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody else in the world would miss it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;What do kids do to play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They move&lt;/strong&gt;. They climb, scramble, swing, slide, crawl, roll, and jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement is FUN, plain and simple&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are sports enjoyable? Because they involve movement. &lt;strong&gt;For whatever reason, humans (all animals actually) seem to &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;enjoy movement&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am not expensive because I live lavishly. I am expensive because, in social and ecological terms, I cost a lot to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My education took place at a university, supported by a huge staff of underpaid workers who themselves would never have the chance to study in the classrooms they cleaned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My fitness training took place in expensive gyms where only very determined or very wealthy people could afford to train,  which were stocked with equipment shipped across the world from China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My nutrition, on Paleo, was supported by the deaths of more animals than I care to count (with such a strong reliance on protein) and costly exotic fruits and vegetables (like coconut oil).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My writing takes place on a MacBook Air, one of the most expensive pen-and-paper substitutes in existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a financial point of view, I don&#39;t spend too much. From a resource perspective, however, I consume a lot. &lt;strong&gt;Of all the 7+ billion humans on Earth, I am easily among the costliest for the planet to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Living</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-cost-of-living/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2134&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;200&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/DSC_6310.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2134&#34; title=&#34;Small Hostel&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_6310-200x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The cramped but lovely hostel we stayed at in Kyoto[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short post, because I&#39;m in Kyoto and don&#39;t want to be spending too much time on my computer, but something I&#39;ve experienced in Japan has got me to thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything here is very small&lt;/strong&gt;: the houses, the cars, the trains, the towels. There is a mentality that we should not use more than we need. That applies to space, food, money and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is not a developing country. It is fairly affluent. It &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;expensive to live here, but that hasn&#39;t always been the case, and many of the small buildings are much older than Japan&#39;s current situation. It wouldn&#39;t be beyond the Japanese to have SUVs lining the streets, towering apartment complexes with massive floorplans, and showers with hot water that didn&#39;t need to be prepared ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know Japan has a lot of problems, and the Japanese do some pretty atrocious things (like massacre dolphins), but I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and suggest that you can have respect for resources without unreasonable hatred of cetaceans. The two are not necessarily linked to each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I&#39;m comparing Japan to America, where everyone aspires to a half-acre lot with a 40,000 sq. ft. pre-fab house sitting atop a hill, with an SUV or two in the driveway. &lt;strong&gt;Towels are big, meals are big, and everything is cheap, so it doesn&#39;t matter if you waste it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing is cheap here in Japan, and that is a strong reminder to use things wisely and only buy what you need&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Heroes are rare. That&#39;s why we tell legends about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroes do the things nobody else can do, the things nobody else has the courage or the will to do. Heroes do the hard things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without heroes, society sits on auto-pilot because we are kept &lt;a title=&#34;The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/&#34;&gt;unaware&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody fights to see the truth. And when the truth surfaces anyway--the problems society can no longer hide--there is nobody with the intention or the &lt;a title=&#34;The Compete Human Being&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-compete-human-being/&#34;&gt;integrity &lt;/a&gt;to stand up, do the work, and change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; heroes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could be a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But heroes are rare for a reason.</description>

      <title>Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/movnat-instructor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/movnat-instructor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cagedworld.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2117&#34; title=&#34;cagedworld&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cagedworld-283x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;283&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Learning is all about freedom. The more you know, the more options you have. Knowledge is both liberating and empowering.” ~Erwan Le Corre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I read &lt;a title=&#34;MovNat Men&#39;s Health Article&#34; href=&#34;http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/fitness-survive-wild&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chris McDougall&#39;s article on MovNat in Men&#39;s Health&lt;/a&gt; back in 2009, I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the computer screen, rolling over what it meant in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere, in the forests of Brazil, &lt;a title=&#34;Erwan Le Corre MovNat Sampler&#34; href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m61t3ObnSP0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;there was a man living in harmony with nature&lt;/a&gt;, climbing trees, vaulting over rocks, carrying logs, jumping from boulder to boulder, teaching people to grow past the limits of their sad, domesticated bodies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen something and immediately felt, &#34;I have &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; to do that. If there is one thing I must do in my life, this...is...it!&#34;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t just want to go do one workshop and be done with it. I wanted to live it. I wanted to be that wild and free. I wanted to get so good, I&#39;d give Le Corre, the founder, a run for his money. I wanted to spread the word, show people that being healthy &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;doesn&#39;t mean hours on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; or tedious, repetitive movement. It can--it should--mean &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vibrant, moving, freedom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the article provided more information on the history of Methode Naturelle, the precursor to MovNat, than information on MovNat itself. MovNat at the time was small and not well-known. I was in college, broke, beat down by my studies at one of the most masochistic universities in the country, and &lt;strong&gt;very, very far away from running wild and free in the forests of Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;. I was at a dead end, but the seed had been planted.</description>

It&#39;s my view on life, but it&#39;s been a real pain figuring out what the overarching theme on my life is. I mean, how do you tie together my interest in &lt;a title=&#34;Empty Your Cup: Accepting Ignorance to Learn&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empty-your-cup-accepting-ignorance-to-learn/&#34;&gt;Buddhist spirituality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/&#34;&gt;evolutionary fitness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Returning to the Dojo: The Importance of Martial Arts&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/returning-to-the-dojo-the-importance-of-martial-arts/&#34;&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Book Review: The Omnivore’s Dilemma&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-onivores-dilemma/&#34;&gt;local food&lt;/a&gt;, environmentalism, &lt;a title=&#34;The Value of Failure&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-value-of-failure/&#34;&gt;positive psychology&lt;/a&gt;, and holistic personal health and growth? To me, all of those things are one and the same, but Google keyword searches don&#39;t generally group them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I realized that this blog isn&#39;t really about &lt;em&gt;those &lt;/em&gt;things. It is about the approach to living that &lt;em&gt;led&lt;/em&gt; me to those things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the keywords of my life? What about my approach to life led me to adopt evolutionary fitness instead of Fatbusters 2.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; I Prefer the Term...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reading &lt;em&gt;Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, I&#39;ve spent some time thinking about the words I want to describe me and my lifestyle. I have already written a lot about Integrity, and I know that is a central part of who I want to be and what I believe characterizes the Warrior Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all good things come in threes, I needed two more words. Naturally, I looked to the most annoying things about me.</description>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/livin-la-vida-expat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3901537243_085c10c684.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2054&#34; title=&#34;Expat Living&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3901537243_085c10c684-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Never write about a place until you&#39;re away from it, because that gives you perspective.&#34; -Ernest Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an American expat living in South Korea. Glamourous, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up as an expat living in Kuwait and Dubai. My American dad hung out with Arabs and Westerners alike, so we had friends from all over. My sister and I went to an American school and were taught English at the expense of Arabic (actually, many wealthy Arabs sent their kids to the American school as well. It was the trendy thing to do). While most kids might have spent their lazy summers playing baseball at the neighborhood park or just playing in the street, we spent every day rambling around exclusive beach clubs. We were able to afford luxuries that we wouldn&#39;t have been able to have in the States, like a live-in nanny. I grew accustomed to a lifestyle that was very different from what I&#39;d find in America when we &#39;returned&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vintage Expat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&#39;m a complete nerd, the word expat brings to mind &lt;strong&gt;Ernest Hemingway&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Gertrude Stein&lt;/strong&gt;, chilling at cafes in Paris where they can be &lt;a title=&#34;Get Out of the Box!&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/get-out-of-the-box/&#34;&gt;free to think&lt;/a&gt; their own thoughts which eventually find their way back home to change society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&#39;m &lt;a title=&#34;We’re Going to Make It&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/were-going-to-make-it/&#34;&gt;living in Korea&lt;/a&gt;, I realize that the reality is more like my childhood in the Middle East. Being an expat is about escaping responsibility and living it up. It involves a surprising amount of alcohol (though I&#39;m sure Hemingway, at least, did not limit his imbibing to dainty French coffees), and a lot of partying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think this perception is limited to my experience in Korea. I just finished John Wood&#39;s book, &lt;em&gt;Leaving Microsoft to Change the World,&lt;/em&gt; and the author shares his commentary on the lifestyle of Microsoft expats living in Sydney and Beijing, which is one of &lt;strong&gt;glamour&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;escapism&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;entitlement&lt;/strong&gt;. Those who epitomize the lifestyle do it because they can live the high life, making a relatively high income and taking advantage of favorable economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wood&#39;s case, he and his girlfriend were both emblematic of the expat lifestyle in China. As a Microsoft employee, Wood had plenty of money, and living in China, which was less developed than it is today, he was able to have all sorts of luxuries he wouldn&#39;t get otherwise, such as a personal driver. His girlfriend had come from the rural Midwest and was so hooked on the glamorous life that she refused to go on vacations that didn&#39;t involve resorts and 4-star hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I would be going too far to suggest that for many, living abroad is seen as an extended vacation with perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing wrong with that, and if it occurs in a context of &lt;a title=&#34;Empty Your Cup: Accepting Ignorance to Learn&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empty-your-cup-accepting-ignorance-to-learn/&#34;&gt;learning new perspectives&lt;/a&gt; living in a new country, all the better.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2035&#34; title=&#34;Slow Food Snail&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg-300x298.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People used to hunt for their food, or risk their lives to find and gather it. When we settled down to farm, we still had to work hard all year to ensure we had enough. Food was needed to live, but we also paid a high price to acquire it. So, when we ate it, we respected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how healthy I eat, I never seem to enjoy the &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt; when all I can think about is the &lt;em&gt;nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. I never realized how important it is to bring some compassion to mealtime in order to truly benefit from eating. This attitude elevates eating from mere consumption for the sake of maintenance, to true Nourishment, that gives us the energy to rise above life’s challenges, instead of simply enduring them.</description>

      <title>Why Don&#39;t Women Want to be Strong?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-dont-women-want-to-be-strong/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/why-dont-women-want-to-be-strong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Go in peace my daughter. And remember that, in a world of ordinary mortals, you are a Wonder Woman.” Queen Hippolyte to Wonder Woman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2027&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;283&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/3896838102_1273912e8e.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2027&#34; title=&#34;angie&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3896838102_1273912e8e-283x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;283&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/imagesbywestfall/3896838102/&#34;&gt;greg westfall on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#39;ideal&#39; woman is toned but not muscular, thin but not skinny (or is it the other way around?). She has curves, but no hips or butt. The &#39;ideal&#39; woman is also apparently defined solely by her body&#39;s appearance. &lt;strong&gt;The &#39;ideal&#39; woman is a biological contradiction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I have gathered as a guy, the world of exercise and fitness is a minefield for woman. It is promised as the path to a sexy, &lt;em&gt;thin&lt;/em&gt; body, but one misstep could lead a woman to functionally useful strength or worse, mannishness (which apparently means any visible muscle definition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The phrase a &#39;strong woman&#39; brings to mind tenacity, persistence, mental toughness, but almost never physical strength. Why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that standards of beauty should be a reflection of physical health: that which is considered beautiful ought to correlate to that which is healthy: a healthy human being, man or women, is a beautiful human being. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, we associated feminine frailty with feminine beauty, to the detriment of women (and men) everywhere. The media has cemented this image, with even action heroines sporting builds that could never perform the stunts they execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my opinion doesn&#39;t matter all that much. If women want to conform to a standard of beauty that does not allow for health, that&#39;s their choice, and I know that for many women, attractiveness is a far, far more pressing concern than health. &lt;strong&gt;In fact, healthy behavior is pursued only as a means to acquire an attractive appearance.&lt;/strong&gt; This works to an extent because humans are hardwired to prefer the appearance of a healthy human over an unhealthy one. Biologically, attractiveness is an indicator of underlying health, so we seek out attractive mates because they are more likely to produce healthy offspring and survive the hardships of life. From an evolutionary perspective, attractiveness itself is not the desirable trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should be more concerned about health than about attractiveness&lt;/strong&gt;. Using diet and exercise in order to acquire a nice appearance begs the question of what happens when you no longer need or want to look attractive. Do you just start neglecting your health? After all, if health was only a means to look nice, it would only be pursued for the sake of appearance. There would be no concern about longevity, usefulness to others, or even respect for one&#39;s own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human organism expresses its greatest health when it is functionally adept. When it can move well, it looks good. When it is well nourished, it looks good. That makes it attractive to others, as a side effect, as a flag telling others the organism is succeeding and flourishing. &lt;strong&gt;When you achieve vitality and vibrant health--when you flourish--you are beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>Am I Too Young to Matter?</title>

&lt;p&gt;“You can only be young once. But you can always be immature.” -Dave Barry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation on Twitter in which I was sharing some insights on health and life. My conversation partner thought that I was making some very good points, and all was going well. Then she revealed that she is married with kids, and suddenly I thought, &#34;What wisdom can I offer this person, who has seen so much more of life than I?&#34; I was embarrassed, even though she had agreed with my ideas and said that her experiences confirmed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I have a belief that I cannot offer much to the world because I am so young. All of my ideas have only been around a short time, and the hard trial of years hasn&#39;t yet tested their worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is my youth really that much of a handicap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I share my insights on life, there is a voice in my head saying people older than me might dismiss my ideas because I&#39;m only 25. They might wonder how much I could possibly have gleaned from my life in that short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m encouraging happiness, I worry they will think that I haven&#39;t accepted that life is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m talking about difficulty, I worry they will think that I have an entitlement complex, that I expect the world to be handed to me because I&#39;m young and don&#39;t yet know how to do hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s really no way to win over stubborn old people (especially when you&#39;re not sure they really think that way at all).</description>

      <title>Fitness is Not Health</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/fitness-is-not-health/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2008&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomsaint/3752937440/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2008 &#34; title=&#34;Tired Runners&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3752937440_4641fa806d.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rennett Stowe on Flickr[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing my fitness book and thinking about how I want to explain my views to others, I&#39;ve realized that I was never really comfortable with fitness as we normally conceive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness is a confusing term these days. It has become so confusing, in fact, that you can have Fitness without Health. You can be very good at the Fitness thing, exercising religiously, following the right diet, wearing the right $70 Yoga pants, and be completely miserable. Originally meant to be a means to promote our holistic health, Fitness has taken on a life of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define Fitness, I want put aside dictionary definitions and focus on what most people mean when they talk about Fitness. I&#39;m concerned with ideas and conceptions, not academic or scientific definitions that have little to do with how people interact with the term in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most, fitness is synonymous with athletic performance: the better your fitness, the better athlete you are. It is also synonymous with health: the better your fitness, the healthier you are. So, the assumption is that athletes are healthy, meaning their bodies express the full range of human function, painlessly, and for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Unhealthy Athlete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we know that not all great athletes are healthy. The standards of a sport do not always require holistic human health to perform well (think golf), and sometimes the requirements of excellence in a sport actually favor adaptations that cause health problems. When an elite runner dies of heart failure, what do we make of it? How do we reconcile the awe-inspiring performance of gymnasts with the spine and shoulder problems that come with the intensive practice?</description>

      <title>A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/245952551_797503484e.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-1995&#34; title=&#34;Bodies in Motion&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/245952551_797503484e.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; height=&#34;270&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Many people treat their bodies as if they were rented from Hertz--something they are using to get around in but nothing they genuinely care about understanding. - Chungliang Al Huang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was thought that a human being could be perfectly healthy eating only parts of food, as long as they were in sufficient quantities and ratios. The nutrient model of diet claimed that we simply needed sufficient protein, carbohydrates, and fats, plus vitamins, in order to be healthy. Foods were broken down, proteins, vitamins, and minerals extracted, removed, concentrated, and added back in sufficient quantities. We had mastered the science of nutrition and were entering a golden age of health and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for that...the nutrient model has been discredited lately, as it became more and more obvious that the benefits of whole foods, eaten fresh and close to the source, simply could not be copied by even the most carefully scientifically balanced meals. Sometimes this was because of the limits of our technology, but just as often, there were factors we hadn&#39;t even identified that seemed to make the difference between health-promoting and obesity-inducing food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness and exercise is where nutrition was a few years ago. We are only now starting to pull out of the mistaken belief that movement-related health can be broken down into its constituent parts and fed in concentrations to promote certain kinds of growth. Happily, we have mostly discarded the notion that the body can respond to training muscles in isolation on weight machines. Unfortunately, we still pull movement apart into elements like strength, speed, power, agility, coordination, balance, and flexibility, just as we used to think of food only in terms of its proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Out there things happen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And frequently do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To people as brainy and footsy as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dr. Seuss, &lt;em&gt;Oh the Places You&#39;ll Go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a place where travelers go, full of wonder and exotic foods and people. Conveniently, everyone speaks English when you need to communicate, but they maintain their quant, authentic accent and obligingly speak in their native tongue among themselves. They can show you around, if you can pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a new, distant country, so you&#39;re guaranteed an adventure, and you can rest secure in the knowledge that you are widening your horizons, being cosmopolitan, and expanding your mind. Perhaps many of your friends are still at home, taking vacations to safe, boring places like Florida or Yosemite. But in this country, you can See Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get very, very comprehensive guide books, written by Seasoned Travelers, and so presented from a perspective you&#39;d understand. There are signs, too, printed so you can read them. The books and the signs will tell you all the best places to go, so you can be sure you won&#39;t miss out on the Complete Experience. Every tourist who comes through has seen these most wondrous sights, and if you didn&#39;t, you&#39;d be missing out. It&#39;s really very easy anyway, so why not just follow the signs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paths are well-marked, and well-trodden. They are paved and kept in good condition (but with careful attention to preserving the suggestion of age, the patina of local culture). You won&#39;t trip or sprain an ankle. All the best restaurants are on these paths, and plenty of comfortable, accommodating places to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the countryside, you ask?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Isn&#39;t freedom to move the most fundamental freedom there is? - Erwan Le Corre, founder MovNat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that walking tires you out quickly. You cannot walk more than five minutes before desperately needing a rest. Add to that the fact that you are too weak to carry a day&#39;s worth of food more than five minutes. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re also too inflexible to sit comfortably on the ground for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now try to imagine all the places you cannot go: anywhere without cars, regular and cheap food, or chairs. You are strongly dependent on the presence and goodwill of other people for things as simple as your comfort. Because of your inability to move your body and endure hardship, you have fewer options for where you can go and the things you can do. You literally could not go more than five minutes without needing someone or something to help you. If you get stuck or behind schedule, you&#39;re screwed because you cannot run to catch a bus, much less a few miles to the nearest gas station if your car breaks down out of cell phone range on an urgent errand. You are dependent, in a very visceral sense.</description>

      <title>Six-Month Assessment: Now the Fun Starts</title>

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been living, on our own, in Korea for 6 months at this point, which is one half of our planned stay.  More than being a cultural experience, these past months have been an exploration of personal growth. My girlfriend and I have learned a lot about choosing our own paths and the little things that make a self-directed life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure many of you are wondering how we’re doing at this critical juncture.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is your intention everyday just to survive? Is your intention everyday just to make it through the world, because your interpretation is &#39;the world is so hard, so stressful, so chaotic, I hope I can just get through this day&#39;? Because if that&#39;s where you&#39;re at, that identity for you is small. - Brendon Burchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to whine...a lot. Practically every word out of my mouth was a complaint of some kind. I was either talking about my frustration over my homework load, kvetching over the constant barrage of e-mails, or just going on about random aches and pains and fatigue. The only information I had to share with anyone was about how something was bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hardly conscious of my behavior; whining just seemed to be the natural thing to say, and after all, it seemed to me that most conversations were based around complaining. People would get together after work to basically whine about the difficult week. Guys would bond over complaining about their girlfriends, and women would commiserate over the poor quality of men in their lives. Most of the student conversations I heard were about academic frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was not pleasant to be around, and my family made this very clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t want to be that guy nobody invites to parties (I was already that guy, and knew it wasn&#39;t fun). I didn&#39;t want to be the guy nobody could rely on who couldn&#39;t handle his own life. So I resolved to change what I thought was a seemingly simple habit of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how deep it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rule I instituted was: if what I am about to say is something negative and simply expresses how I feel bad about something, with no suggestion of actually fixing the problem, I will keep my mouth shut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only moderate self-control, I did very well at this. It was merely a matter of keeping my lips sealed. Sometimes I found I had nothing to contribute to conversations, but at least I wasn&#39;t bringing people down anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I made a horrifying discovery.</description>

      <title>The Value of Failure</title>

&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of criticism for my failed attempt at starting a t-shirt design company. We had one run of t-shirts, I didn&#39;t sell all of them, and my income was so low I couldn&#39;t even cover the cost of the website hosting. I lost a lot of money, too. Some might think this is strong evidence that I shouldn&#39;t go into business, since I couldn&#39;t make even a small project work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have told the naysayers that I intend to try again. The usual response is a look of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot by failing, and I want to try applying the lessons to another project and see if I can make something else work. Isn&#39;t that the whole point of learning? &lt;strong&gt;Make the failure worth something by learning from it.</description>

      <title>What Does it Mean to &#34;Be Yourself?&#34;</title>

&lt;p&gt;When you are content to be simply yourself and don&#39;t compare or compete, everyone will respect you. -Lao Tsu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why it is so hard to be myself, but it seems to be the biggest challenge I have faced in life. From what I read of others’ journeys, it is a universal struggle. Not only is it difficult, it is fraught with dead ends, false trails, and misleading half-truths. For many of us, we don’t even realize we are not being ourselves. We think we are acting spontaneously and expressing a creative individuality, but in fact we are mimicking some idea of individuality or are simply repeating old habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to ‘be yourself?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think ‘being yourself’ is the kind of thing you can talk about directly. It is the subject of Buddhist meditation, the mystic’s search for communion with the divine, and an entire literature of spiritual, scientific, and cultural studies. So, to explain what I think it means to ‘be yourself’ I will resort to an example.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“If you wait to do everything until you&#39;re sure it&#39;s right, you&#39;ll probably never do much of anything.” -Win Borden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really experience life, you&#39;re going to have to get out of line first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I studied Arabic in Jordan, I initially applied to go through a program. It was quite a prestigious program, and it promised all sorts of  exciting (pre-arranged) adventures in addition to a language study at the University of Jordan. The brochure also stressed how safe it was and how secure the travelling student would be, even as they learned to step outside their comfort zone on a study abroad program. I had my misgivings, but when I got a phone call letting me know I was accepted, I was very excited...until the lady got to the part about the cost of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in the Middle East, I knew that the costs were inflated. I asked if I could just stay with my family there and spare them the living expenses, but the woman (quickly getting annoyed with me for daring to suggest I might have a better experience through other channels) explained that it would detract from the experience. This didn&#39;t answer my question, and she ended the conversation by saying that if I didn&#39;t pay soon, they would give the spot to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never followed up with that group. I simply signed up for the University of Jordan&#39;s Arabic program directly. Of course, there were some bumps in the road because of that, but when I showed up with twenty or so other students who hadn&#39;t finalized their registrations, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; had to &#34;step out of my comfort zone&#34; to speak for all of them and cow the program director into letting us all join the program a day late. That would never have happened if I&#39;d went with the &#39;secure&#39; program.</description>

      <title>When Is It Selfish to Help Others?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/when-is-it-selfish-to-help-others/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The most significant lesson I ever learned in trust-based relationships is that all anybody asks for is respect. If you give them that, you have extended the greatest sign of love and compassion there is. If you don’t give them respect, you’re not really loving them. You’re simply looking after them, attached to them, or maybe even taking advantage of them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you think this is obvious, but consider how many times we ‘love’ without giving respect: parents taking care of their children with no concern for what the child wants; codependent couples using each other to bolster their own self-esteem; men and women with a need to rescue their partner or be a hero; friends who hang out together because they look better in comparison to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True respect, true compassion, involves the recognition that the other person is a complete, functional, human being&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if they need help in some things, they are still complete beings.</description>

“Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” -Albert Einstein
 The hardest thing I’ve encountered in becoming happy and successful is that it can make other people upset. Even if most people are happy for you, that one voice of resentment can destroy you.
That provides a great excuse to hold yourself back: we’d rather be liked than happy (the absurdity of that statement should be apparent).</description>

My father’s mother passed away before I ever met her and lived on as a sort of legend of my childhood. My mother’s mother spoke no English, and to her I was just one of dozens of grandchildren, probably not one of the more interesting ones. A strained relationship with my mother was perhaps translated to me as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I never felt I had a grandmother. But though she wasn’t officially family, I had Auntie Phyllis, and that was, as far as I was concerned, a better deal anyway.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine the serene sense of control you’ll have, effortlessly flitting from one task to another, making decisions with a quicksilver wit, and being as engaged with your family as your work life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pretty mouth-watering prospect, if you ask me.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have recently been burned in two business interactions that left me hurting both financially and personally. Not only did I lose money, I felt taken advantage of and cheapened. I invited my clients to undervalue my hard work by undervaluing it myself. It’s a hard pill to swallow, but I realize it’s all part of the learning process, and the more I delve into business, the more I realize how much &lt;a title=&#34;The Principles of ‘Good’ Business&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-principles-of-good-business/&#34;&gt;good business&lt;/a&gt; relies on good character.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“I have never taken any exercise except sleeping and resting.” - Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensity in exercise is good. Most of us aren’t getting enough of it. Instead we settle for lifting weights we can handle comfortably and running at speeds that just break a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are those of us who do nothing but high intensity exercise. We’re CrossFitters and Traceurs, MMA fighters and sprinters. We only have one speed, and that’s insane! We are not know for our gentleness, with others or ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be one of those. Until I got injured, which happened a lot actually. When you’re body is constantly working near its limits, there is not much time for healing or recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most recent injury was a pulled muscle in my hip that immobilized my lower back. I couldn’t even bend over to tie my shoes. I had zero flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of options and fed up with being in pain all the time, I started practicing yoga to regain my flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started it only as a therapeutic form of exercise, but I noticed that I felt much better on days I started with some yoga than those without. Clearly yoga was addressing some aspect of my physical training I’d been neglecting with all the CrossFit and gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intense stretching didn&#39;t help at all. The painful deep tissue massage didn&#39;t help, either. But slow, comfortable, gentle yoga slowly untied my back and improved my flexibility in other areas as well. When I finally started being gentle and kind to my body, it stopped punishing me with pain.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As much as I love travelling, I don&#39;t necessarily think that travelling automatically leads to good stories, and ultimately, I don&#39;t want this to be a travel blog. Stories comes from overcoming all sorts of challenges. It just so happens that most of the time, travelling forces us to step outside of our comfort zone and face new challenges. Like masses of rowdy Korean children or &lt;a title=&#34;The Garbage Bag Hunt&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p1Zk76-3m&#34;&gt;strangely elusive garbage bags&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I have a few stories worth telling that have nothing to do with travelling. The best stories are about a turning point or a moment that changed everything. Here is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting up alone, way after everyone else had gone to sleep, watching a movie on TV that had me completely riveted. I had just gotten back to the States after spending the summer of my junior year of college in Jordan studying Arabic. In Jordan, I had started exercising after being totally sedentary for most of college, but after getting home, I had fallen off the wagon, and I was in only slightly better shape than I had been when I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie I was watching was &lt;em&gt;The Karate Kid, &lt;/em&gt;and it set me down a course that has completely changed almost everything about me, from my body, to the way I see the world, my belief in my own judgement, and my ability to talk to girls.&lt;img title=&#34;More...&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/trans.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;</description>

      <title>Why My Favorite Students are the Most Difficult</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/brickwall.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1875&#34; title=&#34;brickwall&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/brickwall-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“When we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure” - Peter Marshall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an English teacher, I deal with kids of all ability levels. There are the star students who do all the homework, even the assignments you don’t really expect anyone to do, answer all the questions perfectly, and are polite, engaged and generally perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the students who fall asleep in class, which is a good day because when they are awake they are disruptive, harassing other students, yelling for no apparent reason, and making the classroom a living hell. Trying to teach them is like talking to a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess which students I appreciate more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at first. The first few weeks working as a teacher, I loathed dealing with them. I wanted to just ignore their failing grades and total lack of understanding, but the little voice in my head said that, as the teacher, I should go over and help, even if it wouldn’t make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it did make a difference. In fact, it made a big difference. The kids improved (slightly) but their attitudes improved a lot. They tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More importantly, I improved as a teacher&lt;/strong&gt;. I started to get a sense of what worked and what didn’t. If I could learn to motivate the worst students, I would be that much better at motivating everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, I could teach the best students with my eyes closed (actually, they can teach themselves). Unfortunately, as teachers it is so tempting to give all our attention to the good students, since they clearly appreciate and value us. But now, with my new perspective on the frustrating kids, I actually enjoy working with them. When I bring that kind of energy to the interaction, it makes it more pleasant for everyone, and then they start to make an effort.</description>

“The best contribution one can make to humanity is to improve oneself.” - Anon
 I’ve always felt that learning is one of the best ways to improve oneself (I guess you could get philosophical and point out that self-improvement is essentially learning in one form or another). Reading books is one of the best ways to learn, which is why I include a lot of book reviews here.</description>

      <title>The Secret of Unleashing Creativity</title>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1868&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; caption=&#34;416style on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sookie/149498941/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1868&#34; title=&#34;Blank Canvas&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/149498941_c1e8d9cd08-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you&#39;ve got to let everything go - purge yourself. If you are unhappy with anything . . . whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you&#39;ll find that when you&#39;re free, your true creativity, your true self comes out.” - Tina Turner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity! The word rings of freedom, personal fulfillment, making a difference. It is how we contribute to the world around us and &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; new realities out of our ideas. Most of us were very creative when we were young. When I was younger, I was immensely creative. I would write short stories daily. I was constantly drawing things on my school papers, and I filled up several sketchbooks. I even wrote poetry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought that my creativity was the result of a messy, hectic life, but my life got a lot messier in college, right about the time my creativity disappeared.</description>

      <title>Did You Forget Why You Came This Way?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I wake up earlier than I want to, and work longer than I want do, at a job that wasn’t my idea, creating something that was never on my radar for things I want to accomplish in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do I do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably to get paid so that I can live, but walking through the snow yesterday to the school where I work, I couldn’t help but wonder what the point of making enough money to live was. What would I do with the living that I earned? Just make more living, more money, so that I could go on buying food and renting a roof over my head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt the need to rise above the clouds of my day-to-day for a little bit, to get a wider perspective on my life and why I do what I do.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“He who has health, has hope. And he who has hope, has everything&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.thinkexist.com/quotation/he_who_has_health-has_hope-and_he_who_has_hope/149145.html&#34;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;” - Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leave all the afternoon for exercise and recreation, which are as necessary as reading. I will rather say more necessary because health is worth more than learning.” - Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the one thing you can do to improve almost every aspect of your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, I don’t know you, but the thing that makes the biggest difference in my day to day life is looking after my health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this means eating right, &lt;a title=&#34;Lessons Learned as a Trainer and Athlete&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/lessons-learned-as-a-trainer-and-athlete/&#34;&gt;exercising regularly and intensely&lt;/a&gt;, and getting enough sleep. It means I take my health into my own hands, instead of just accepting what the government or the media tells me. It’s your body; take the time to get to know it, what makes it happy, and what is good for it, instead of relying on people who have zero interest in your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the really obvious effects looking after my health has had. Most of them have nothing to do with the body itself, but instead are reflections on the areas of life that we really live for.</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Education of Millionaires</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-Education-of-Millionaires.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1844&#34; title=&#34;The-Education-of-Millionaires&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/The-Education-of-Millionaires-198x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;198&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every now and then, a book comes along that redefines the way you see the world. Michael Ellsberg&#39;s book is just such a one. It snares you with its controversial premise: &lt;strong&gt;higher education fails to provide the skills necessary to be successful in the real world&lt;/strong&gt;. It keeps you reading by explaining what skills you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;need and how to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has every wondered why, with their expensive degree and pristine grades, they are stuck working meaningless jobs that make no use of their skills, this book provides both the answer and the solution to bettering their chances to make it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Education of Millionaires&#34; href=&#34;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-of-millionaires-michael-ellsberg/1103297348?ean=9781591844204&amp;amp;itm=1&amp;amp;usri=the+education+of+millionaires&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Education of Millionaires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basically presents a course list for success in business and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a strong advocate of &lt;a title=&#34;The Principles of &#39;Good&#39; Business&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p15g8X-tF&#34;&gt;business with integrity&lt;/a&gt; and success as a means to make a positive difference in the world.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be” -George Sheehan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a series three books on how to change the world, how to give as much as possible to your community, and how to help others get the things they need. The first was a book on how to become wealthy, the second was a book about becoming indispensable to your company, and the third was simply a book about selling. Yes, these were business books, but not business books in the way I usually think about the genre.</description>

      <title>My Holiday Thanks You&#39;s</title>

&lt;p&gt;I love this time of year. The cozy winter drinks, the warm crackling fires after a day in the cold, people bundled up but still extending warm greetings and presents. While it&#39;d be great to be this thoughtful all year, it is still nice to step out of our self-centered mindset, even if just for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays are a time when people take a moment to remember the important people in their lives. My usual holiday tradition has been to write handwritten cards to all the people who have made a difference in my life in the past year. It&#39;s sort of a massive thank you note for the intangible things that my friends have done for me throughout the year, whether that was just to be there and listen, to hang out and have fun, or give me much-needed help or advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, however, I got so caught up in my move to South Korea that I didn&#39;t get around to making all the cards. So, if you don&#39;t get something from me, please know that doesn&#39;t mean I forgot, just that life has been very busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to my community. This past year, I&#39;ve learned that so much of what makes us who we are is who makes up our community. We are, to a very large extent, the result of our friends, families, followers, and teachers. &lt;strong&gt;I want to acknowledge just how much of who I am is the result of the generous contributions of others who have seen something in me worth supporting&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There is a point in every challenging experience where you go from questioning whether you&#39;ve got what it takes to survive and to feeling secure that things will be alright. You&#39;ve been staring up at an impending wave, not sure you&#39;ll get to the other side, but now you&#39;re on top, and you can see the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me living in Korea, I passed that point a few days ago. Nothing really has changed around me, but something inside me clicked. Finding my balance point is less of a daily struggle, I&#39;m starting to groove my daily paths and activities and get a sense for my surroundings. A and I have slowly transformed our apartment into a living space that reflects the kind of lives we want to live, so we are no longer fitting ourselves into someone else&#39;s living space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I can see further and, while I may not feel that I&#39;ve accomplished that state of security just yet, I know it is attainable.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor&#39;s cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. &#34;It&#39;s overfull! No more will go in!&#34; the professor blurted. &#34;You are like this cup,&#34; the master replied, &#34;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to South Korea to teach English to kids for a year. Adjusting to the new culture has been both humorous and challenging; things that I usually consider very simple have become extremely difficult. Basics of living—eating healthy, exercising regularly, and even basic hygiene—have new rules and best practices that I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to accept that I really don’t know how to do much around here.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I know I haven’t posted to Warrior Spirit in a very long time. My concern was that the topic of the blog was becoming too vague and nebulous. I aspire to write stories for adventure magazines and grand science-fiction epics, neither of which were things this blog showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I haven’t found Warrior Spirit to be especially rewarding. There is very little community interaction on the blog. Articles don’t get shared often, nobody links to the blog, and I don’t get many comments. Sometimes I felt like I was writing in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to put it to rest and focus on other, more concrete projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then, I received a direct request to continue Warrior Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

No surprise there. What is really surprising is that all of our myths follow the same basic story arc. At least, this is the claim of Joseph Campbell, whose research into the mythologies of the world over has revealed that all cultures have strikingly similar myth’s underlying the basic fabric of society, the guide the development of the members of that society.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Women do not have it easy in our society. For example, they get &lt;a title=&#34;Miss Representation&#34; href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=2349117563337&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;objectified&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Why a Woman Can Never Win Against a Man&#34; href=&#34;http://www.care2.com/causes/why-a-woman-can-never-win-against-a-man.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;have their world records revoked&lt;/a&gt;, and are underrepresented in American government. Nobody thinks these things are okay (and if you do, you suck). Women also have to put up with an unrealistic and extremely narrow definition of beauty. Yet a lot of men see no reason to work to change they way they see women or deal with them. Would you boycott almost every show on TV? Would you date a girl you respected, even if she wasn’t stereotypically sexual? Would you turn down the svelte, leggy blonde for the intelligent, athletic brunette?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, for many men, the answer is no, even if they would prefer to meet the latter lady. The result is that a lot of women feel that they aren’t desirable unless they look a particular way. The problem doesn’t just affect women, however.</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</title>

And yet while a squirrel can look at an acorn and know instinctively that it is good to eat, we have to consider our food options. With so much variety, the only way we know what is good to eat and what isn’t is through trial and error, cultural norms, and our sense of taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the omnivore’s dilemma, and it forms the basis for the book by Michael Pollan, which explores how we modern humans produce, acquire, and prepare our food.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Willpower</title>

Eating fat doesn’t make you fat. Running in shoes can be bad for your feet. Giving yourself free reign to express your every desire and emotion can mire your personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one will require some explanation, especially since there is a lot of talk here on Warrior Spirit about the importance of listening to your heart and following your dreams, no matter what comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just finished a book summarizing the psychological research on the topic of willpower and self-control. The book, &lt;em&gt;Willpower, &lt;/em&gt;by psychologists Roy F. Baumeister and John Tierney, is rife with examples of how the failure to set and follow limitations leads to a breakdown of character. It is mainly a survey of the research, but what makes it readable is the authors’ sincere interest in helping the reader, and the interviews with such characters as endurance artist David Blaine (who spent 63 hours encased in a block of ice in Times Square) and Amanda Palmer (known for her tabloid-friendly outbursts). The authors also draw examples on how willpower can be utilized from Ophrah, Eric Clapton and Henry Morton Stanley.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are people living very happily right now without a home. There are people enjoying life floating on a boat or migrating from place to place with all their belongings on the backs of steppe ponies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are happy, successful people without stable, secure, 9-5 jobs. There are happy, fulfilled people working in mailrooms, stockrooms, and vast libraries, with minimal human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are folks who are do all their work at night, hardly ever see the light of day, and who are perfectly healthy and well adjusted. There are some people, who do bring value to their communities, who live without any money at all, relying on their own ingenuity and the charity of their friends to get by, or they live as part of a self-sustaining community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a slightly more radical note, there are people getting a really good education without going to school and who have their dream jobs without ever finishing college, despite what our parents told us.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I have been planning to live and work abroad for the past year, and recently all of our plans completely fell apart thanks to a school that went back on our contract. The result was that we spent two weeks scrambling for another position, another job, or just anything to move our lives forward. For two weeks, we were in total limbo.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Remember in Bambi how much of a wimp Bambi was as a young buck? Compared to his father, the king of the forest, he was still just a whelp, even though technically a fully grown deer. His father, on the other hand, was a fully mature stag, quite literally an embodiment of the spirit of the forest. How often do we see out own parents that way: at the peak of their power, rather than in decline?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level. -Bruce Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lee was one of the greatest martial artists who ever lived. But did he think that gave him an excuse to stop improving? If the above quotation is any indication, the answer is no. Bruce Lee was always growing and always pushing his limits.</description>

&lt;p&gt;They say kids these days seem to have a sense of entitlement. Since ‘they’ were referring to ‘kids’ my age (aka, me) I tended to disagree with this statement. Apparently a lot of kids my age are turning down low-level service oriented jobs because we think we are above that sort of work. I tell myself I am endowed with good old fashioned values, can exercise self-discipline, and am not afraid to get my hands dirty. I can do menial tasks well and cheerfully, glad at the opportunity to be a part of something, even if just a small part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, I LOVE helping other people! I live to serve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my dad asked me to help him take the car in for service.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had an interest in joining the military. I wanted to be a jet fighter pilot, or a special forces operative. For the first time in my life, I have no reason to be afraid of the physical demands of the job; I routinely best soldiers in fitness competitions, and I could pass the special forces entrance exams. I’m confident enough in myself to withstand the rigors of training, and I feel more certain than ever that I could benefit from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have had to let go of that dream as I’ve come to understand the realities of what a soldier does. In order to live out my dream, I would have to compromise on a lot of things that are really important to me. This isn’t because of the nature of the military generally, but rather the way the system is set up currently. I could get behind fighting against Hitler in World War II, but I have never been very good at investing myself in other peoples’ agendas if I don’t believe in them.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little kid, I’ve had a powerful sense of the imminence of my own death. Not that I expected to die in the near future, but I was always painfully aware that one day would be my last, and eventually, I would cease to experience anything ever again. I would get panic attacks mulling over the reality of my mortality. For a 9 year-old kid, that’s pretty heavy stuff. I still sometimes catch my mind wandering over to the other side, and as a result, my whole life I’ve carried with me an urgency to make the most of my time. I don’t know whether this is common or not, but I’m just acutely aware that one day, there will be no more me.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I find myself surrounded by people who are unhappy with their lot in life. They don&#39;t have the body they want, the job they want, the partner they want, or the skills they want. Every day they want to be something they aren&#39;t, and every day instad of making progress towards their dreams, they distract themselves or rationalize away their inability to have what they want.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered how great things get accomplished in this world. It&#39;s so hard to get past the day-to-day of basic social niceties, the need to make a living, following current fashion trends, and doing what&#39;s expected of you. How does anyone have time to do anything else? Where do you find the time to redefine a field when most modern fields require all your time just to stay current? How do you become all that you can be when being the bare minimum is a full time job?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post from Eric Fulwiler, an Account Executive at VaynerMedia, am NYC digital agency specializing in social. He blogs at &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.ericfulwiler.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog.ericfulwiler.com&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find him on Twitter @EFulwiler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we find certain  activities easier than others? It&#39;s so easy for us to sit down and watch a 3-hour baseball game (at least, for some of us), but it&#39;s so hard for us to sit down for 3 hours and write a Powerpoint presentation. Part of it is certainly because baseball is more entertaining than Powerpoint (again, for some of us), but the bigger issue here is the standards and expectations that we have created for ourselves. We have standards embedded within our mentality that dictate the ease and attractiveness of certain activities. We have chosen to believe that baseball is easier than Powerpoint. And these choices have resulted in standards that frequently present obstacles to our personal or professional productivity. But for those of us who accept that we can control these standards, we can realign them to further our goals, and significantly increase our productivity and potential.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last week helping my family move our home, which is partly why I&#39;ve been remiss in posting for so long. We are downsizing because the kids are out of the nest (even though I still live at home and my sister just moved back after college. Go figure). My parents are trying to save space and money, but doing so required us to come to grips with the fact that we have tons of stuff, massive quantities of things we didn&#39;t even remember we owned, from all over the world, much of it outdated and unusable.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I was a kid, I used to read a lot of morality tales, and one of my favorite was about the effects of harsh words and the effectiveness of apology. Here it is, as best I can remember.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young boy had a bad temper. He would yell at his sister and his mother, and was very impertinent to his father. Generally, he was a pain, and he was pretty much immune to all forms of discipline and punishment, though his parents tried their best.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on feedback after the original version of this article, I realized that some of what I said was not expressed clearly and could be interpreted as devaluing people&#39;s accomplishments. I was also jumping to conclusions in some cases and generalizing. I meant no disrespect to any of my readers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases of doctors and surgeons who rise to the top of their peer groups, gaining renown for the medical problems they are able to solve. They earn the respect and admiration of their peers and the deep appreciation of the patients they save. Then, one day, it is discovered that they never went to medical school, and in fact forged their diplomas. They are stopped from practicing of course, and some are arrested. But everyone who knows them maintains that they were excellent doctors. They simply didn&#39;t have the correct paperwork.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As a CrossFit trainer, I sometimes feel like I&#39;m not allowed to use, much less espouse, alternative forms of physical training or diet. But since I&#39;ve been caught so many times doing very un-CrossFit-like things, and a lot of people ask me what my training program is, or what my diet is, I thought I&#39;d come clean.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a really humorous series of short videos about how to be suave while living at your parents’ house after college. A young man in a bathrobe introduced himself as so many of us graduates do: a list of impressive academic accomplishments, compelling personality traits, a powerful drive for success, and, oh yeah, unemployed and living at home. The narrator then goes on to explain how to ‘be suave’ while living around your parents. For example, dealing with the fact that your mom still does your laundry, or capitalizing on recurring fashion cycles to make use of your dad’s wardrobe.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to have consistently awesome days, and after much trial and error (most of it documented on this blog), I&#39;ve come up with the following list of activities that seem to contribute to days worth having. The elements are pretty open-ended, and allow for multiple interpretations or ways of meeting the requirements, but they help me make sure I cover all the important bases.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have come to the realization that I am a weird dude.  Furthermore, I have finally accepted that I am one of the weirdest  people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I was holding out that I just had a few  eccentricities related to my exercise and dietary habits. After a while,  though, these things started to impact other areas of my life, and the  weirdness started to grow. An interest in barefoot running turned into a  general refusal to wear shoes. A concern with healthy food led to  eating raw meat. It became very hard to deny that I’m just strange.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Learning to enjoy my downtime has been one of the most  difficult challenges I’ve had to face in my recent life. I have always  felt a need to fill every spare minute of my time with some project, so I  tend to have a lot of things going on at the same time. The problem  with that is I never feel like I have the right to just sit and enjoy  myself.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Traffic has been especially bad lately. As I worked my way through New York traffic the other day, I was astounded at how many miles of road there are and that every single one is choked with traffic. There are just so many cars on the road. It is worrying to me knowing all the resources that not only went into producing those cars, but also go into keeping them running every single day. It’s not that there are a lot of cars. There is an incomprehensible number. As far as the eye can see, nothing but smog-spewing vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this be sustainable?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cash or friends? Despite our assertion that the latter is more important, our behavior often suggests that we value money more than our relationships. We tend to work ourselves to death, and if there is any time left over, we think about seeing our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best friend is returning home from a year working in West Virginia, in a town that is 3 hours from the nearest interstate, in some of the most beautiful country I’ve ever seen. When he left to go work there, I drove down with him, and now that he is coming back, I’ve offered to drive down to get the rest of his stuff and help him bring it home. He has already driven half of it back, so we will be leaving together to get the rest, spending a week down there, and then driving home again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I explained to some friends that I would be out of town next week, and why, they seemed surprised that I would go to so much trouble just to provide my friend with company on his long drive back and forth.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“A  human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,  butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance  accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give  orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem,  pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently,  die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” - Lazarus Long&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Campbell pointed out in his book &lt;em&gt;Myths to Live By &lt;/em&gt;that,  as humans have become more and more specialized, they have started to  feel like bigger and bigger chunks of their being are empty. When all  you are comfortable doing is studying and researching and you can’t feel  capable in the physical or social realm, you discover big areas of life  completely closed off to you.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I say that you do not recognize before you and around you  any but those office-holders whole commissions have been signed by a  minister or a king; and that the men whom God has put above these  office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow  out instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your narrow,  limited field of observation. - The Count of Monte Cristo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the usual question we ask kids—“What do you want  to be when you grow up?”—is the wrong sort of question. Instead, we  should be asking them, “What do you want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Count of Monte Cristo points out in the above  quotation, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who fill  posts and those who pursue missions. The two are not always mutually  exclusive, but they are usually very separate ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, the difference seems to be that a post is limiting while a mission is empowering.</description>

      <title>Nine Days in Portugal for $1525</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/porto.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1662&#34; title=&#34;porto&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/porto-300x200.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My girlfriend and I just returned from a nine day trip to  Portugal, in which we stayed at the Sheraton Lisboa, a number of  hostels, toured Lisbon and Porto for two days each, and spent two days  at the fishing village of Peniche. We ate really, really well (a little  too well actually), usually at restaurants with a few home-cooked meals.  We took trams and buses and trains all over the place, and spent a day  exploring an island off the coast. We also spent a day in Barcelona,  Spain, on our way to Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And we did is all for $1525 per person&lt;/strong&gt;. Considering  how poorly we managed our money, I think that is a pretty good deal,  and it includes all incidentals. The cost of airfare getting to Portugal  and back was only $725 per person, and accommodation was less than $200  per person for the whole trip. If you cooked more of your own meals at  hostels, or weren’t so ditzy about navigating public transportation,  your incidentals would have been lower than ours (about $600).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that I am only occasionally employed, it seems that if we can make this happen, anyone should be able to do it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this seems ridiculously affordable, I thought I’d share how we did it.</description>

      <title>The Spirit of Exploration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I are spending the week in Lisbon, Portugal. Why Lisbon, you ask? Because Portugal was the jumping off point for some of histories most adventurous and courageous ventures, led by such eminent personages as Vasco de Gama (discoverer of the sea route to India), Bartholemeu Dias (the first European to round the Cape of Good Hope) and the far-sighted, exploration minded King Henry the Navigator. I believe that this culture of exploration and discovery epitomizes the Warrior Spirit, so I thought I&#39;d come out here and try to soak up some of that courage. ;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing a New eBook</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned last week that I was working on an eBook for  all my excellent readers. I’m sure you’ve been dying for details since  then (or maybe not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I’m putting together a collection of ‘Spirit  Quest’ stories from some of my friends who are living inspiring lives.  It occurred to me that having examples of inspiration might provide some  extra push for my readers who are trying to figure life out (that would  be everyone, I guess).</description>

      <title>Intensity vs. Efficiency</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’d rather train to outrun a bear than to fight one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am more likely to actually attain my goal of outrunning a  bear, and will be able to apply that skill in a variety of  environments. If there are trees, I can climb them. If there is water, I  can swim. Climbing cliffs and rocks is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, I simply train to be massively strong in  hopes of eventually overpowering the bear, I am starting at a distinct  disadvantage. Additionally, if I do face the bear in a fight, even if I  win (which is extremely unlikely), I am much more likely to get injured.</description>

      <title>Have You Ever Had an Original Thought?</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was reading a short piece on creative motivation last  week that asserted that very few of our thoughts are truly our own.  According to the author, most of what we think falls into the category  of ‘monkey-mind,’ which is a term I recognized from studying Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it refers to the thought process that jumps from  one topic to another without ever really getting anywhere. Like a  distracted monkey in a playpen, the mind simply takes up whatever  catches its interest for a moment. It may play with the idea for a  while, but quickly discards it for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with true clarity of thought in which the  mind is focused on a singular aim at the exclusion of all else. By  remaining focused and mostly empty, the clear mind can direct all its  energies to accomplishing some task or plan.</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I started this blog, I had no aspirations to do  anything more than share my thoughts about life and the world. I figured some of the things I was going through might be  interesting to others, mainly my family. I didn’t really set out to tell  anyone how to live their life or even provide advice. I was just  sharing my experience of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This differs markedly from how blogs are getting used these days as a platform to establish the author as an expert with no other credentials besides the blog itself.</description>

      <description>A break from the usual thought-provoking stuff to share something I&#39;m getting really passionate about: Movement Naturale! This was the original functional fitness program developed by the French before WWI. I read about it years ago, and it was what initially sparked my interest in other functional fitness programs like CrossFit. Partly because it was so intense, I didn&#39;t really entertain the notion of getting into it right off the bat, but now that I&#39;ve developed a good base from CrossFit and have started trail running, I&#39;m probably going to start incorporating some of it into my fitness program.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need eyes to see. You just need to believe.” - Caroline Casey, TEDWomen, Dec 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is dedicated to my friend Steffi, who just graduated college and who isn’t settling for the conventional aspirations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker above is legally blind, and yet she dreamed  about being a racecar driver. That didn’t work out, but she did ride an  elephant across India and was a very high powered executive for a number  of years. She never let her eyesight slow her down or lower her  expectations for herself. And she certainly never let anyone else’s idea  of what she should be able to do determine what she aimed for.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since finishing the CrossFit sectionals, I’ve been taking a  break from fitness for the last two weeks. Basically I have tried to  relax about fitness and just do what I feel like in terms of exercise  and nutrition. I expected to lose some ground with my training, but I  felt that I was due for a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is I have actually gotten stronger and  faster. I recently ran a few quarter-mile intervals and put up some of  my fastest times ever. My front lever has become so solid I can do  bicycle crunches while holding myself horizontal. Clearly, I just needed  some rest to develop the latent strength. Leading up to sectionals, I  was so uptight about workouts and diet, and I did pretty well, but now  that I’ve stopped worrying so much, I seem to be doing just as well  anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems that I do just as well (or better) not worrying about stuff and I do when I worry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why worry?</description>

&lt;p&gt;It would be too easy to be perfect all the time. It is  far more difficult to accept that you’re not perfect but to believe  that you have worthwhile things to say despite that, and to say those  things with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last two weeks, I’d been in a bit of a rut.  Things that used to excite me didn’t appeal to me anymore. Exercise,  gymnastics, trail running, and even writing all seemed tedious and  boring. All I wanted to do all day was go home and sleep, and when I got  home, I didn’t want to sleep. I was just generally out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also seemed to be messing up everything good in my life.  Professionally, I’d given up a lot of hours training to work on my  writing, with the result that I was pretty broke. My  iPad-as-laptop-replacement experiment was a failure, so I had to buy a  new laptop. My relationship with my girlfriend was in a rough patch,  which just makes everything else seems hellish. I wasn’t sleeping well,  and all I wanted to eat was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which  was a problem because I don’t keep jelly at my house and most bread  gives me indigestion. My room was a mess, and I was out of clean  underwear and floss (surprisingly discouraging, actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to say that things have improved, though I still  need to invest in some floss, but I wanted to talk a little bit about  the weirdness of being an inspirational writer and not always feeling  inspired.</description>

&lt;p&gt;What if you could get past pain and discomfort by  accepting it and relaxing into it? I don’t mean that the pain goes away,  but rather that you become okay with it. You still feel it, but it  doesn’t bother you. You can get on with whatever it is you’re doing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to run barefoot for a long time, since the Vibram FiveFingers came out several years ago. Unfortunately, I’ve also been injuring myself since that time. Undaunted, I’ve kept trying new methods to learn, different ways to ease into it, and different cross-training and recovery techniques. In the end, it was a kind shoestore clerk and an epic story that made the difference. The clerk at the shoe store gave me a barefoot running instructional book (free just for showing interest in a pair of shoes he ordered that I didn’t even have to purchase). The epic story was &lt;em&gt;Born to Run.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was going on a rant about all the problems with the fitness industry the other day, as I often do, and one of the few things I said of value was that fitness isn’t about the body, at least not ultimately. It is about the spirit. We mainly want to have healthy bodies so that we can enjoy life, feel confident and strong, experience lots of cool adventures, and play with our grandkids. Most people don’t want to lose weight just for the sake of losing weight, but because they believe it will make them happier. After all, isn’t that why we do everything – in order to be happy?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;There are a thousand reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.&#34; - a cool t-shirt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make a mistake even worse? You whine and complain about it and make lots of excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I performed a CrossFit workout in which I wasn&#39;t too happy with my performance. It was a surprisingly difficult one, involving a lot of burpees, followed by a lot of overhead squats, followed by muscle ups. I&#39;m very good at the first and the last movement, and apparently not so hot at the second. But I was so keen on getting to my strength - the muscle ups - that when I finally did, I lost all my focus and went crazy. The result was that I got just a single muscle up in two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the buzzer went off, I let out an angry yell, uttering a curse I never use in my daily life. It just sort of slipped out, and I was immediately ashamed of myself. Not because I had cursed - lots of people do that - but that I had gotten so angry that I did something so out of character.</description>

      <title>Forays in Barefoot Running</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started barefoot running. Not just going out to the mail in my bare feet. Not jogging in light shoes. Full on, running down the road with no shoes on, barefoot running. So far my maximum distance is about 3/4 mile, and I&#39;m taking it slowly, but it is addictive, and holding back is the hardest part.</description>

      <title>Lessons in Minimalism from Camping</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I was but a wee lad, my dad used to drag me kicking and screaming into the woods to partake in an activity which, due to its lack of video games, easily available chocolate, and LEGOs, I was not too keen on. That activity was camping. As a kid, I hated it. Now, it is necessary to my spiritual well-being.</description>

Are you having fun?
I don&#39;t mean bounce-off-the-walls giddy. Nor do I mean partying until 3am every day.
But basically, do you enjoy your days? Do you get a kick out of your schedule? Do you have something interesting and new to excite you planned every day?
Do you want to get out of bed every morning?
A lot of my friends do not.</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I had an annoying tendency to question everything my teachers told me. This got me sent to the principle on more than one occasion. As an adult, I tried to suppress this habit and like the rest of us, very quickly became enamored of experts. Until last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a few months working with so-called fitness experts, I was finally ready to become one myself by getting my Level 1 CrossFit trainer certification. I drove the presenters insane with my questions, because I knew that they were oversimplifying, leaving stuff out, or were just plain wrong. I had done my own research, from a number of different sources, and come to my own conclusions. I was not ready to drink the Kool-Aid, no matter how expertly prepared or convincingly presented.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that moving to college is just as uncomfortable and awkward as moving back home afterwards? Or that starting a new job is just as nerve-wracking as being unemployed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, we get used to the new routine, and we wonder how we ever got along without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the wonder - and frustration - of human adaptation: &lt;strong&gt;we can feel comfortable doing things we hate and supremely out of our element doing things we love and want to do&lt;/strong&gt;.  </description>

      <description>What would it take for you to drop everything and go after what you want?
A lot of people wait for someone close to them to pass away. That&#39;s what it takes to remind them that life is too precious to waste in going through the motions.
Some people need a wake up call in the form of catastrophic failure. After spending a fortune and many years in law school, they lose their job as a lawyer.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a terrible Wednesday. On that day, I did poorly on a workout I was confident I could do well in. I had to leave Kenpo early because I was so exhausted and beat up, and when I got home, I had a stomach ache. I started panicking about how hungry I was because I thought if I ate food so late I would not be able to sleep, and I was already exhausted. My mom and girlfriend can attest to how immature I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was totally different. It was sunny, for one, and I made sure to get enough sleep. Even though traffic kept me from making some appointments, I brushed it off and wore a smile all day long. I had a great time chaperoning my 7th and 8th grade cross country team, and ended the day tired but not exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&#39;m Khaled. This is my blog, Warrior Spirit. It&#39;s kind of my personal epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem a little presumptuous to suggest that my life is worthy of an epic, and maybe it’s not yet. However, I believe that if I treat it as epic-worthy, it will live up to that calling. The whole point is simply to live as awesome a life as possible and hope that it proves worthy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I undertook the fourth installment of the CrossFit Sectionals Open Workouts. It looked right up my alley, involving two movements I am very good at - burpees and muscle ups - and only one that I wasn&#39;t - heavy overhead squat (really, I&#39;m not good at much that is heavy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I was confident I would do well. All I had to do was suffer through the squats in order to get to one of my strengths. Unfortunately, I found the squats too much, and I didn&#39;t even manage to finish them before the timer buzzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt defeated. Even with the advantage of having my strengths, I was stopped by one thing that I&#39;m weak at.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little boy, I&#39;ve wanted to be a writer. Back then, that meant I got to spend all day writing stories, which was something I loved doing. I couldn&#39;t imagine a better way to spend my time than telling stories about dragons and spaceships. Since that&#39;s what writers did, I wanted to be a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started learning gymnastics, I wasn&#39;t the only adult at the gym. But I was the only adult on the rings and I was the only person there with no formal gymnastics experience as a child (excluding the Parkour crowd and one other guy who had started in college).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my previous experience, my age, and my chosen apparatus of still rings, there weren&#39;t many who thought I would go far. After all, there weren&#39;t many (if any) who had come into gymnastics late with the intent of picking up much beyond tumbling and flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my coach and I moved slowly, exploring different ways to progress and learn that might be unique to my situation. Every training session was an adventure, because I didn&#39;t know anyone who had done what I was trying to do. I didn&#39;t know what to expect, or how I would ultimately fare.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This morning while I was practicing Karate by a forest stream (yeah, I do things like that), a duck hen floated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped to watch her go and was struck by how at-home she seemed. If I blocked out the houses at the top of the hill, I could imagine we were out in the untamed wilderness. She didn&#39;t seem bothered by the fact that there were houses and cars and roads just over the hill, nor by the fact that there was a human by her stream. She was a duck, in the river, in the forest, just as things should be.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.&#34; -Walt Whitman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YAWP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YAWP!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YAWP!!!!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YAAAAAWWWWP!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend had me screaming this at the top of my lungs in the middle of a local park, as a exercise in letting myself be heard. After my yell (there was only one) I cringed, waiting for something bad to happen, as if I&#39;d broken some rule by being loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that I am kind of scared of being noticed, which is sort of a problem if I&#39;m trying to be a world famous author who writes insightful and controversial works on the nature of the human spirit. Presumably, if I do that well, I&#39;d be noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in classic over-analytical fashion, it occured to me that I might be tamping down my excellent writing in order not to be noticed. My subconscious (insidious little bugger) knew that if I wrote all the earth-shattering and poignant things I wanted to write, people would in fact start to notice, and then all my YAWPing would put me in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now I&#39;ve figured out what my subconcious has been up to behind my back...NO MORE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a personal trainer now for about two years, and I&#39;ve been actively training myself for about three. It has been quite a journey, and I&#39;ve come a long way. When I started, I could only dream of doing a pull up. Now it is my strongest movement. Handstands were so far beyond my abilities as to be pure fantasy, and now I spend a lot of time inverted. I&#39;ve travelled a long road in a short amount of time, and I&#39;ve learned a few lessons along the way that I thought I would share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Warrior Spirit</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to inject a little more of me into my posts. After all, this blog was started by me as a sort of online journal. I was reluctant to assume that all my readers found my life all that interesting, but I thought I&#39;d just write about it. I am a storyteller, after all, not just an essayist. Since the story I know best is my own, I wanted to tell that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, I got swept up by all these other great blogs that also tell stories, but which also provide lots of useful information besides. Somehow, the information stuck out more than the stories, and I focused on that. As a result, I feel that Warrior Spirit has kind of drifted from being personal to trying too hard to be useful. The result I think has been less connection with my readers. The blog has grown and grown, and for that I&#39;m thankful, but I feel a little like I&#39;ve sold out (except without the monetary rewards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m going to try to tell more of my stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Start Your Day Right with an Anchor</title>

&lt;p&gt;The image of the lone warrior training every day at dawn is a popular one in the martial arts. Like clockwork, the Warrior rises before her companions have even stirred to run through her training. She does this in the mornings, so that there is no possibility of distraction. It is her source of strength, for even in the midst of a quest, she finds time to hone her skills and focus her mind for the day&#39;s coming struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel frustrated by the inconsistency in your days? While change and excitement are great, I&#39;ve always found that I really appreciate having at least a few things that are steady that I can turn to in order to get into the right mindset for the day. Alternatively, having something later in the day that I can expect helps me forget all the troubles and problems that have cropped up. An afternoon run will do wonders to help you put the stresses of a long workday behind you so that you can focus your energies on being with your family in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency in difficult times to stop before the end of our rope. Things start to get too hard and the voice in our head says, &#34;We are almost finished. We&#39;d better stop before we actually fail.&#34; And so we stop to rest, even though there was no concrete evidence of our immiment failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last week, I&#39;ve sold my laptop and replaced it with an Apple iPad 2. This leaves me without a regular computer capable of such basic functions as running flash programs, storing more than a few hours of music and video, and playing the most interesting games out there. Instead, I&#39;ve got myself a tiny, super light tablet about 10&#34; large that I can take anywhere. And, even more important, I have no distractions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my chosen fitness niche, there is a tendency to only focus on what gets results and ignore the rest. CrossFitters tend to scoff at bodybuilders and pro football players alike. The belief is that these individuals are wasting their time as far as fitness is concerned because they are too specialized and not lined up for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, strict adherents of the Paleo diet tend to dismiss those who only follow it partially. Anyone who knows anything about nutrition wouldn’t go near a loaf of bread, ever! If you do, you don’t take your health seriously. You should either change your ways or give up completely. So say the perfectly fit. Go the whole 9 yards, or not at all.</description>

      <title>The Care and Feeding of Your Totem Animal or Spirit Guide</title>

&lt;p&gt;What animal are you? We tend to get skeptical when asked this question, though many of us have identified with a particular animal at one point in our lives. We like to think we grow out of it, but we all need inspiration from time to time, something to push us to our best. Often, we will look towards other people who embody the qualities we would like to have. However, throughout history, humans have frequently looked to the natural world for their strength and ideals. Warriors, shamans, and everyday folk have taken animals are symbols of what they would like to be themselves.</description>

      <title>Us vs. Nature: The Need for Understanding</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/usvnature/</link>

&lt;p&gt;If we had no choice but to destroy the natural world or destroy ourselves, which do you think we would pick? Let’s say that Nature has decided she has had enough. She won’t kill us outright, but she has determined to eliminate all aspects of our unsustainable lives, which means she sends her warriors to take out our property, vehicles, and infrastructure. Insects would lay waste to crops, sacrificing themselves to the pesticides, leaving organic foods untouched (assuming the crops themselves didn’t turn against us by simply refusing to produce). Rodents would flood our homes, tearing them apart from the inside, leaving us unscathed by demolishing everything manufactured, everything chemically-treated, everything unnatural. Trees and plants would suddenly demonstrate an uncanny determination to grow roots under, over, and into our buildings and roads, slowly but inexorably pulling them to pieces.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why do we follow rules that don’t suit us? Why do we dutifully get in line for things we don’t even want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do it because we are told we should do it, because a “good person” would want that, or simply because everyone else is doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last few weeks learning how to take advantage of the Frequent Flyer system by using credit card tricks and rewards programs. Most everyone I talk to about this seems excited, but they helpfully warn me that it is dangerous to play with credit and the financial institutions. If you don’t follow the rules and expectations, they you’ll get burned, they say. There must be some way for the credit cards and airlines to punish me for using the system in a way it was not intended to be used. My friends can’t really think of what it is, but they insist there must be one.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My generation is surrounded by hundreds of ways to instantaneously get in touch with old friends. We have Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, iPhones, Droids, Wi-fi hotspots, 3G networks, text messages, e-mail, instant messaging, and even that old standby, the telephone. And yet, almost all of my old friends claim that they are horrible at staying in touch. On a whim, they can say hello to someone with the touch of a button, and yet, we hear from one another so infrequently many of us wonder what the point of social technology is in the first place.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay...I&#39;ve really got it this time. Seriously. &lt;strong&gt;I now know what this blog is about&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I&#39;ve said that a lot before, but this time it&#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. See that snazzy new subtitle. This blog isn&#39;t about me anymore (well, I guess it will always kind of be about me). It&#39;s about &lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;, trying to make ourselves the best we can be, so that we can be the most awesome, helpful, revolutionary, world-changing people we can.</description>

      <title>How To Best Use Your Teacher</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/how-to-best-use-your-teacher/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1400&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;286&#34; caption=&#34;velvettangerine on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/velvettangerine/3922005142/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1400&#34; title=&#34;teacher&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teacher-286x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;286&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re trying to learn something or achieve a skill, a teacher can be a big help, since they have already done what you want to do. But there are some pitfalls to having a teacher, especially if you try to put all the responsibility for your progress on their shoulders. The best way to use a teacher is as a resource for your own learning, not as the basis or sole motivation for your goals.&lt;em&gt; (if you&#39;re short on time, you can skip to the end of the article for a summary, a policy I&#39;ll be using more regularly)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trainer, I work with a lot of people who want to get in great shape, but don&#39;t really want to put in the effort. Sure, they do the exercises I recommend when they show up, and they push themselves pretty hard. But then I won&#39;t see them for weeks. They have lessons maybe once a month, very intermittently, and as a result, they don&#39;t move towards their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have trainees who see me about that often, but who do make progress. The difference is in the way they view our relationship. To the first group, I am responsible for their fitness progress. &lt;strong&gt;To the second group, I am merely a resource for them as they make their own journey towards fitness&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having studied the martial arts in some capacity for most of my life, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the stories of seemingly magical powers attributed to some of the martial arts masters. Men and women whose training goes far beyond a simple &#39;black belt&#39; have given to the martial arts a mystique that elevates them beyond their traditional roots as fighting systems. Through the study of combat, it is promised, you may find inner peace, harmony, focus, and personal balance.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why jump off the bridge just because everyone else is doing it? You can step back from the bridge, turn around, and walk away into new adventures that had previously been only fleeting ideas. You can also help other people walk away from the bridge, or you can rewrite the rules the brought to the bridge in the first place. The possibilities are unlimited, but it all begins with the deliberate decision to think differently - Chris Guillebeau., &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I did a book review, as I&#39;ve been reading several books at once. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve finally managed to finish one, by fellow blogger and inspiration Chris Guillebeau of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;. Chris is a self-described traveler and writer. He pays the bills by writing (which he can do from anywhere), and spends as much time as possible travelling the world with the ultimate goal of visiting every country. His book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity,&lt;/em&gt; provides readers with a glimpse of his unorthodox worldviews which, he maintains, are much more empowering and liberating than the traditional worldview we are taught to follow.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A number of pseudo-emergencies have conspired to keep me from writing anything in the last few days, and I apologize for that. I&#39;m realizing it would be useful to have a backup store of posts I can share if I don&#39;t have the time or ability to write a new one each day. Which brings me to my topic for today: setting more time aside to write.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Every time I open up Wordpress to start a new post, I am presented with a totally blank text box. Lately, I&#39;ve found it difficult to come up with topics, and so I spend a few minutes just staring at the computer. There is something ominous about a blank page - you are responsible for any marks or changes that occur, and what if they aren&#39;t perfect? There is also something liberating about a blank page, but only if you know how to look at it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;With the recent trouble over the approval of GM alfalfa, we have been faced with the reality of a very un-sustainable agriculture in this country. Incidentally, the use of GM crops also threatens our health, but what about other circumstnaces where we must seemingly choose between health and sustainability? Does it make sense to adopt an eating pattern that promotes optimal health if it requires us to eat in a way that is detrimental to the planet and our society?</description>

&lt;p&gt;“The history of free men is never really written by chance but by choice - their choice” - Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/letter-to-the-president/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Letter to the President&lt;/a&gt;, a reader brought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_22449.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article &lt;/a&gt;to my attention, explaining how the organic elite, such entities as Whole Foods, Organic Valley, and Stonyfield Farms, have expressed their acceptance of GM crops. Whole Foods has apparently decided to stop opposing GM crops, and in return they are demanding compensation for farmers. The article also points out that most of Whole Foods products are not organic (no surprise), and that most of them are also contaminated with GM foods (also no surprise, since GM corn soybeans are used to make most of the additives in foods, including soy lecithin, modified food starch, dextrose, xantham gum, etc). So, despite their green image, Whole Foods has a vested interest in keeping labels off of foods with GMOs in them.</description>

      <description>Many of you are aware that the USDA recently approved GE alfalfa, and you probably guessed I&#39;m pretty upset. I rarely get involved politically in anything, but I thought I could at least fill out an online petition. But then I realized I didn&#39;t want to get lost in the mail. Instead of filling out a form on a website, I decided to actually print out and mail my letter to President Obama.</description>

&lt;p&gt;When you have habits outside the norm, people look at you funny, even when they admire what you do. I avoid sugar at all costs. Everyone I know thinks this is a good idea in terms of nutrition and health, something they&#39;d hypothetically like to do, but they don&#39;t really envision themselves as able to give up sugar. It is just too far outside of the normal American dietary experience. My friends ask wistfully how they can lose weight or have my energy levels. I tell them, don&#39;t eat sugar, and they respond with, &#34;I wish I could do that, but I just couldn&#39;t give up sugar. I love it too much. How can you live without eating sugar?&#34;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&#39;ve been able to commit myself to a more minimalist approach to training. As an multi-sport athlete, I&#39;ve always found it difficult to focus my training on one or two things. Instead, I&#39;ve found myself always jumping around, never giving enough time to any particular method to make much headway. Alternatively, I&#39;ve toyed with trying to do everything all the time, and quickly burned myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, by limiting the time I can train, I am finding myself more motivated to give a good effort in the less time that I do train. &lt;strong&gt;When there is less to do, and less time to do it in, you will push yourself to make the most of what time you do have&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading Bill Bryson&#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Short History of Nearly Everything &lt;/em&gt;lately, and it has set my brain off on several crazy trips into hypothetical imaginings. For example, did you know that every cell in your body converts the chemical energy it absorbs into tiny amounts of electrical energy? There are electric charges racing around every one of the 10,000 trillion cells in your body.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Only the mediocre are always at their best - Jean Giradoux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gymnastics coach recently revealed to me that Olympic gymnasts are only able to perform their routines at the time they compete. Most of the time, they use spotters, and they periodize their training so that they peak when they compete. Many of them can&#39;t even perform some of their hardest skills on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this isn&#39;t especially unique in the world of elite athletes, it does reveal an interesting aspect of excellence: &lt;strong&gt;when you are performing at such a high level, you cannot always be at your best&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

The pattern that emerged was that I have been especially productive when I&#39;m either working for myself or have the freedom to set my own agenda and goals. My happiness is also strongly correlated with my independence.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I realize this article could use some citations. If enough people show interest, I&#39;ll take the time to put them in. Otherwise, I recommend the works of Dr. Vandana Shiva, and any of the recent food politic books (Michael Pollan, eg.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Popular Science &lt;/em&gt;included an article about the benefits of genetically modified food, citing the somewhat unlikely marriage of a plant geneticist and an organic farmer who have combined their work to develop crops that are more resistant to disease and produce higher yields. The newsworthy aspect of all this is that GMOs in this case are both organic and seemingly beneficial to all. After all, as the world&#39;s population continues to grow, we&#39;re going to need more food, and we&#39;re running out of land. Or so says the article.</description>

&lt;p&gt;For many people, the answer to that question is actually that they would rather weigh less. For many women especially, weight is the end-all-be-all of the larger world of health. You can be fit as a fiddle, but if you weight “too much” it doesn’t matter a bit.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise program, CrossFit demands that its participants expose themselves to a wide variety of different challenges; you learn very quickly what you&#39;re good at and what you&#39;re not. Often, one weakness can derail an entire workout as you struggle to make up the slack.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the last two days, I&#39;ve done a pretty poor job of keeping on top of my own schedule. I&#39;ve been rushing around to everything, have been late to two very important appointments, and haven&#39;t had the mental clarity to focus on getting anything done. I offer my apologies to all affected, including the readers of my blog. It&#39;s not much in the way of consolation, but I&#39;ve been suffering more than those I let down; my ability to get enough food and sleep has been pretty well undermined.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything. - William Connor Magee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the productivity newsletters I subscribe to, Psychotactics, recently sent out an article on the best strategies to learn and retain knowledge. The author explained that almost every attempt we make to acquire knowledge is done in such a way as to make it very unlikely we will actually be able to hold on to that knowledge. The reason is simply because we are afraid to test our knowledge and make mistakes and mistakes are the key to knowledge retention.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I interviewed a prospective student for the University of Chicago, as a way to give back to the institution that gave me such a cool diploma (written in English though is may be). After I had gone through all my questions, I asked if she had any questions for me. She did. Her question was, &#34;If you could go back and change one thing in the four years of college, what would it be?&#34;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First off, I apologize for the delayed posting. My internet has been out for two days. Hopefully, things will run more smoothly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, I was on my way home from work when I had to swerve to avoid a truck pulling into my lane to go around what looked like a stopped car. As I passed, I noticed that it wasn&#39;t a stopped car, but rather an overturned car. There had just been some sort of accident. I quickly pulled over and put on my emergency blinkers, figuring I knew some emergency response and could be of help.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There have often been times in my life when things seemed largely out of control. Everything seemed to be just out of my grasp. There was too much on my plate, I wasn&#39;t doing the things I wanted to, I wasn&#39;t moving my life in the direction I wanted to go. Basically, everything was going haywire. At those times, I have always found myself with two possible responses.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the name of health, I engage in some practices that others find pretty weird. I actually don&#39;t find them that odd, and they aren&#39;t really inconvenient to me. I actually really enjoy them. But since they aren&#39;t mainstream, they garner some odd looks. I thought I&#39;d list some of them for your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little rebellion now and then... is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.”- Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/healthy-living-join-the-health-_b_799191.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;claiming that being healthy is a revolutionary act, a difficult process that necessitates you make choices that put you in opposition to the mainstream and the social norm. To be healthy requires you be willing to ostracise yourself in the name of your own well-being because the sad truth is that our society has made poor health the trend and the norm.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you&#39;ve had, and what you&#39;ve learned from them, and less to do with how many birthdays you&#39;ve celebrated.” - Anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often tell me that I am exceptionally mature for my age. Ignoring the truthfulness of this statement, I&#39;ve always been curious what that means exactly. Generally, the implication is that adults are more mature than children, but even as a child, I knew several adults more emotionally unstable than I and who were far worse at taking care of themselves. That said, I also know a few youngsters who make me feel positively infantile. So how is it possible for a younger person to have more maturity than an older person?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, over the course of something like two hours and 15-20 failed attempts, I managed to snatch 165 lbs, which is significant because that is my bodyweight (a snatch is an Olympic weightlifting movement in which you take a bar from the ground to overhead in one motion). I had set a bodyweight snatch as a goal almost a year ago, and had gotten to 160 lbs long before, but that elusive 5 lbs seemed impossible. Yesterday, I decided I would nail it, and in the end, it was mostly this determination that made the difference, rather than any actual performance improvement.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.” - Carl G. Jung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an excerpt out of a book by Carl Jung last night, and was interested to find a concept that parallels one of the ideas in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Hero with a Thousand Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Namely, that every individual must find and undergo their own path to individual self-actualization, rather than being able to follow some generalized path. This probably explains why we can spend so much time reading how-to&#39;s and inspirational blogs and never actually get around to doing something; we are reading about someone else&#39;s hero journey, and trying to take it as the direction for our own. Jung&#39;s point was that there is no universal psychological concept that can be applied to every person&#39;s situation and specific problem, despite the modern trend to try to put everyone under a general diagnosis.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Marmalade in the morning has the same effect on taste buds that a cold shower has on the body.” Jeanine Larmoth (I have no idea what that implies, but it was the only reasonably insightful quotation I could find on cold showers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I discovered that I cannot fall asleep unless I take a cold shower before bed. This seems to cool my system off and trigger an internal warming mechanism that makes me really cozy and helps me fall asleep.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone needs a dog to adore him, and a cat to bring him back to reality” - Anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve been helping out at the CT Humane Society for a few months now, and have spent a lot of time with really adorable, heartbreakingly cute kitties and puppies that want nothing more than to play and be loved. Yeah, it&#39;s rough work, but someone&#39;s got to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve learned a lot of important things from these animals, both from their suffering and the little joys they manage to find in life at the shelter. Here are some examples:</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with reading about all these ways to make things happen, with making plans and taking false starts. You might recall my response to &lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;/em&gt;, in which I established a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-radical-idea/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;very doable plan&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately got sidetracked. All I got out of that experience was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/choose-your-words-carefully/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;new way to see the world&lt;/a&gt; which ought to enable me to live the life I want. It freed me from accepting the normal path and got me to thinking that I can design my own life. But from what I can see I never actually went past designing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I have to wonder why.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is the observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, societies have always gone through cycles of establishment and revolution. The established order, originally meant as liberating, starts to become oppressive in its attempts to institutionalize itself. In turn, revolutionaries rise to oppose the system, to assert individuality and reinstate the balance. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they are incorporated into the existing order, and sometimes they overthrow the current order and establish their own system. We are at a time of revolution, though it is a quiet one.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Warriors are always seeking to grow and learn new things, so it makes sense that we&#39;d have a lot of teachers in our life. As the year comes to a close and I contemplate my card list, I&#39;m realizing that most of the people on it are my teachers and mentors. In the past two years, I&#39;ve acquired an unusually large number of teachers, of exceptionally good quality, and I realize that all the growth and knowledge I&#39;ve acquired is largely thanks to their efforts.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage. You may be destined to become the hero of legend...but your current power would disgrace the proud green of the hero&#39;s tunic you wear. You must use your courage to seek power...and find it you must. Only then will you become the hero for whom this world despairs. - Hero&#39;s Shade, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clad in a green tunic and wielding the legendary Master Sword, Link is the hero of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series of games from Nintendo. Throughout the game&#39;s long history, he has faced countless foes ranging from evil wizards to psychotic masks, solved numerous mind-bending puzzles, and repeatedly saved the world from oblivion. All the while managing to get some time in for leisurely fishing, mini-games, favors for random folks, and practicing his various instruments. Variously depicted as a boy or a young man, Link is the possessor of the Triforce of Courage and is perhaps one of the greatest examples of heroism our young video-game addicted selves might have been exposed to. He has all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/warrior-philosophies/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;traits of a true Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and exemplifies the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/what-is-warrior-spirit/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Warrior Spirit&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Every human being has hundreds of separate people living under his skin. The talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living with him.” - Mel Brooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was standing on the train platform on my way into New York when a young girl standing with her mother looked over and asked me, &#34;Are you a writer?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been asked this before. Normally, if people see me carrying my journal, they ask if I write, but not if I am myself a &#39;writer&#39;. But this girl thought I looked like a writer, with my long hair, unshaven beard, and worn leather jacket. Or maybe it was the classically creative look of my Moleskine journal (thank you Moleskine, I will never make fun of your pretentiousness again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question left me speechless for a moment. I was almost suspicious, as if the girl had asked me, &#34;Would you like an extra $500?&#34; The first thing you want is to say yes, but it just seems too easy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A consumerist society survives off the needs of its members. Thus, it has an interest in convincing the people that they need a wide variety of things and services, else they risk unhappiness and inadequacy. And what better way to support this kind of information campaign than to train people that they are inherently flawed from birth, destined to always come up short without the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/branding-our-lives/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;gracious help of external products and services&lt;/a&gt;, doomed to chronic disease without the newest fad in health foods.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My dad has been baking a lot of bread recently, experimenting with different ingredients and developing his own unique style of bread. When I read his cookbook, I found out why. Instead of simply giving him a bread recipe, the author of his book explains what each step is intended to accomplish: the various factors that determine how much flour to use, how long to let the bread rise, why you let the bread rise, and what occurs in the dough during baking. It borders on chemistry, but the result is that my dad has a much better grasp of why each step must be taken, and can make adjustments to get his desired effect. If he wants to get a crispier crust, he knows what to change and how to compensate to avoid ruining his loaves.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have had a lot of waiting to do as my plans start to gain momentum. There are long periods during which nothing seems to bear any fruit. Farm to Table went silent for a long time, with almost no new comments or community engagement, leading me to get very discouraged. I was lacking motivation in my workouts and didn&#39;t really feel like I was making any progress. My blog seemed to be wallowing in obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of sudden things started to move very quickly, and I realized that it was the quiet times when things were starting to move towards a tipping point. I am getting a lot of people reaching out to connect over Farm to Table, there is a new energy in my training, and I am making all sorts of friends while reconnecting with old ones. It&#39;s almost more than I can handle.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Blogging is not rocket science, it’s about being yourself, and putting what you have into it.&#34; -Unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is both a wonderful and a frustrating experience for a writer. On the one hand, it gives you the opportunity to put your ideas out there with no publishing costs and the freedom to write whatever you want. On the other hand, it leaves all the publicity up to you. It&#39;s like a journal that people might actually care about and read, and it creates the possibility of a self-crafted audience. I&#39;ve come a long way as a blogger, but I still find that I have a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warrior stands defiant, spear in hand, looking over a vast plain. Below him is a world full of challenge and adversity, dangerous enemies and tempting shortcuts. Beyond is a great mountain range, full of promise certainly, but hiding even greater challenges. On the other side...who knows? Hope, transcendence, enlightenment. Or perhaps darker, more sinister rewards hide behind those peaks. All the Warrior knows is that he has decided to scale them, carve a path through the plains and over the mountains, leading the way for others who seek a better life on the other side, guiding them and defending the tribe from the dangers ahead. He knows he may not survive, but he has prepared well and is among the greatest, most capable leaders of his tribe. He is confident and eager to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

His blog, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://zentofitness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zen to Fitness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; is inspired by the idea that health and vitality should not be a struggle. I am not an affiliate marketer for his book; this review is simply me sharing insights on an interesting book I read by a blogger who has inspired my own fitness pursuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a great deal of time learning about and exploring many different kinds of diets, I’ve come across a lot of overly complicated explanations of how to eat healthy. Everyone seems to think their way is best, but I’ve found that the basic principles of diets that actually work are always the same: eat meals balanced in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, made from fresh, high quality ingredients. Avoid too much sugar, and enjoy your food, eating when you’re hungry until you’re full. Whether it’s Paleo, Primal, Zone, Locavore, Vegtarian, Vegan, or Traditional, these principles always seem to hold. Of course, exponents of each diet focus on what makes them different, and this just leads to confusion. Vegans will tell you that eating meat leads to bodily decay, while the Paleo crowd will tell you that not eating meat leads to decrepitude.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. &lt;em&gt;-Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear, Frank Herbert&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; Dune&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say the thing that most scares us is the unfamiliar. We seem naturally wary of things that we don&#39;t know very well, even parts of ourselves that we haven&#39;t dealt with in a very long time. We also shy away from things we have simply never experienced before. Unfortunately, this includes many of the things we&#39;d like to live up to and achieve. So we have a problem; anyone who wants to grow and develop as a human being, to achieve their true potential (aka, their Warrior Spirit), must go from what they know, through what they don&#39;t know, and therefore, must face their fears.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Most People are about as happy as they make up their minds to be &lt;em&gt;- Abraham Lincoln&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The 80/20 Principle, &lt;/a&gt;I was struck by how many useful strategies are presented for increasing one&#39;s happiness. Having spent most of my young adult life pursuing happiness and learning what behaviors and life situations lead to happiness, I was not struck so much by the idea that you can cultivate happiness as by the new approaches to the old problem. I had always taken it for granted that I could be more or less happy, and that was in my control. So it came as a bit of a shock for me when the author spent the larger portion of the section on happiness trying to convince his readers that they happiness was something they could actually control. He cited all sorts of studies and authors showing that people have a say in their happiness level, that we are not simply at the mercy of circumstances.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1194&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;104&#34; caption=&#34;By Richard Koch&#34;]&lt;a style=&#34;&amp;amp;quot;border: none;&#34; href=&#34;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385491743?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=warrspir-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385491743&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; src=&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-1194&#34; title=&#34;The 80/20 Principle&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/51Q7Y-piN-L._SL160_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;104&#34; height=&#34;160&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an amazing, and disturbing, truth: 80% of anything that gets accomplished in your life comes from only 20% of your effort or time. 80% of your grades come from 20% of your studying. 80% of your productivity at work (and therefore the value of your income) comes from only 20% of actual time spent working. 80% of my quality writing is done in only 20% of the time I spend trying to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea - that most of what gets done is due to a minority of the causes - is the basis behind the 80/20 principle. The book, by Richard Koch, explains this concept and then illustrates what the 80/20 principle means for your real, everyday life. The subtitle, &#34;the secret of success by achieving more with less,&#34; is a pretty enticing promise, and I believe that Koch delivers on this promise. &lt;strong&gt;This book will change the way you see the world, and should be read by anyone interested in achieving their potential&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Serving Others in Personal Growth</title>

&lt;p&gt;“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -Napoleon Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much about the Warrior Spirit is centered around independence and self-sufficiency. I talk a lot about the need to stick to our own convictions and believe in our own dreams. There is a lot of standing up against the tide of mediocrity that tries to bring us back into the fold, a lot of fighting for our best lives and the life we want. So it may come as a bit of a shock when I say that a true Warrior is not complete if he only pursues his own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the purpose of developing the self is so that you can serve others better.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Our body is a well-set clock, which keeps good time, but if it be too much or indiscreetly tampered with, the alarm runs out before the hour” -Joseph Hall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my gym. Cross Country season is over. I have absolutely no set, recurring commitments at the moment. I haven&#39;t had this much freedom to pick my own activities since...before preschool. The scary part is that I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;completely at a loss of what to do. Without any boundaries on how I use my time, I would have expected myself to go completely crazy and panic at the prospect of no external structure. Instead, I see before myself a blank canvas, and I&#39;ve got a lot more colors to paint with than I ever have before. My day is mine to use as I see fit.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“To learn something new, take the path that you took yesterday.” - John Burroughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my last day at the CrossFit gym where I had worked for the past year as a coach and personal trainer. I decided several weeks ago to leave the gym and pursue other opportunities on my own, and I finally took the step of leaving. It was a difficult decision, not so much because of financial reasons, but more because I loved working with the amazing athletes and dedicated individuals who came to train with us. Nevertheless, I am excited to be moving forward with my plans, even though there is a great degree of apprehension regarding my financial security. I feel that sometimes we have to pull apart everything we&#39;ve built for ourselves to build something new, or backtrack the path we&#39;ve already been down to look for new turn-offs with a better idea of where we want to go this time.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/KhaledPortrait.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1068&#34; title=&#34;KhaledPortrait&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/KhaledPortrait-300x224.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.” - Dr. Seuss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the responses I got from all of you on that &lt;a href=&#34;http://polldaddy.com/s/444345CCC43313A2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey &lt;/a&gt;I sent out, most of the interest in what I write comes from knowing me. So I thought I&#39;d write out my story, so those of you who didn&#39;t know me before the blog can understand where I&#39;m coming from, where I get my stories and interpretations, and why I care so much about standing up to mediocrity and forging my own destiny.</description>

      <title>Life Lessons from Philosophy: Socrates</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/life-lessons-from-philosophy-socrates/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/life-lessons-from-philosophy-socrates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/croweb/2836991287/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1055&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/socrates-247x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bencrowe on Flickr&#34; width=&#34;247&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am the wisest man in Athens, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing. &lt;em&gt;-Socrates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post from my friend David, an avid philosophizer and community development manager at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://familyrefugecenter.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Family Refuge Center&lt;/a&gt;. He&#39;s the guy in the front of the canoe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One’s first philosophy class is, almost certainly, like a glass of Champaign: 80% froth, 20% golden delight.  Indeed, class discussion was probably a maddening waste of time, and the lecturer was forever pandering to the behests of the idiots; but there were kernels of wisdom to be digested, if you knew where to look.  The first item you read was, undoubtedly, Plato’s account of the Trial of Socrates.  Within this dialogue, you could not have possibly ignored that the wisest man- in the wisest city- claimed to know nothing at all.  This kernal personifies the phrase: &#34;hiding in plain sight&#34; for as it is echoed innumerably, for most, it is passed over like a thrift store gem in a heap of dusty trifles.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hide not your talents. They for use were made. What is a sundial in the shade?&#34; &lt;em&gt;- Benjamin Franklin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really know what you are good at? Or are you, like most people, more aware of your failings than your strengths? And how much of your time is spent doing things you are really good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most people (70% according to the Gallup organization) do not get to work at something they are good at. Most of their time is spent doing a job or duty which they find frustrating, difficult, or unintuitive. This costs them their sense of self-esteem, job satisfaction, and productivity, making them resent their work and perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tom Rath, author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159562015X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=warrspir-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159562015X&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=warrspir-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=159562015X&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
, this is a situation that can be remedied to the benefit of organization and individuals.</description>

&lt;p&gt;You follow what you feel inside&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s intuitive, you don&#39;t have to try&lt;br /&gt;
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it takes my breath away&lt;br /&gt;
What you do, so naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the thunder and I am the lightening&lt;br /&gt;
And I love the way you know who you are&lt;br /&gt;
And to me it&#39;s exciting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine in the services industry is finding the customer relation aspect to be somewhat taxing. No matter how hard she works, there always seems to be some customer who decides to complain anyway. Even when she is doing everything right, someone finds something to criticize. As a very driven individual who always expects the best from herself, she has been trying very hard to rise to the challenges posed and improve her performance, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be helping. Customers still sometimes complain or whine or antagonize her.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;It’s time to stop this madness. The corporation is a hungry beast, and we keep feeding it. Let’s walk away, and let it die from hunger. Let’s free ourselves, and create a world where living things are more important than profits.&#34; &lt;em&gt;-Leo Babauta, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mnmlist.com/corporations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mnmlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make all your own food. Buy all your manufactured goods from individual craftsmen. Learn how to sew and knit. Do your own repairs. Build your own furniture or buy it from a local carpenter. Don&#39;t buy the latest fashion trends. Exercise on your own, at home, with no or very little equipment. Entertain yourself instead of watching TV and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Americans find these suggestions inconvenient, if not downright unpatriotic. We are conditioned to rely on corporations for our stuff and livelihoods.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I went for a 5k run today, the first I&#39;ve undertaken in over a year. Despite all the intense anaerobic exercise I do at CrossFit, the fact that I can run a 5:05 mile, and my powerful legs, I found it extremely difficult. So difficult, in fact, that I walked near the end and got a time that was worse than my best high school time. My ankles are sore and I feel more beat up than usual. But really, I&#39;m not that surprised I didn&#39;t do as well as I thought I could. After all, I may be a very well-rounded athlete, but I know that distance running has become a definite area of neglect in my training.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Eating differently is hard. It&#39;s like being a Yankee fan in Boston, except suddenly everywhere is Boston. There is no real reason why everyone else decides you&#39;re messed up and not worth talking to. They do it simply on principle. So when someone decides to eat differently, they are signing up for being the perpetual oddball, the person you&#39;d think twice about inviting to a party just because feeding them will be so annoyingly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except Anna is definitely not the kind of person you&#39;d think twice about inviting to a party. Anna is the kind of person you&#39;d build the invite list around. And Anna is a vegan, the most extreme and obnoxiously complicated type of person to feed (I know because my sister was one).</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Do or do not. There is no try.&#34; - &lt;em&gt;Yoda,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently learned a back handspring, and a front flip, among some other more complex gymnastics moves. Every time I want to try one without my coach to spot me, he considers whether I&#39;m ready, nods and says, &#34;Alright, give it a shot. The chance of seriously injuring yourself is probably less than 60/40.&#34; He is joking, sort of, but it is true that many of the stunts I attempt are actually quite dangerous. And that is why I don&#39;t mess up. &lt;strong&gt;Without safety nets, I can&#39;t afford to fail.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Choose Your Words Carefully</title>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;We cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.&#34; - Florence Scovel Shinn Artist, Teacher and Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words we use to convey our thoughts and describe our lives influence the way we see the world to a greater extent than most of us realize. It may not seem like a big difference, but choosing to use one word or descriptor over another can help you overcome negative or constraining worldviews. Think about how you talk about your goals. Do you refer to them as dreams or as concrete objectives? Do you talk to yourself in the first or second person? Do you refer to other people using condescending terms (&#39;girls&#39; for all women)? Such subtle changes in the language you use will, over time, change the way you think about people and how others deal with you.</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside the Box You Built Yourself</title>

&lt;p&gt;“There are people who put their dreams in a little box and say, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve got dreams, of course I&#39;ve got dreams.&#34; Then they put the box away and bring it out once in awhile to look in it, and yep, they&#39;re still there.” -Emma Bombeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little kid, I was taught that I could not support myself doing something fun that I loved. I would have to find a job that tediously &#39;contributed&#39; to society in order to make enough money so I&#39;d have the resources to spend my free time engaged in enjoyable &#39;hobbies&#39;. Life would always be a trade off between doing what you had to, based on what someone else deemed was a valuable use of your time, and doing what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve begun to question the assumption that doing something you enjoy is a poor way to make money. Of course, if you&#39;re really lucky, you&#39;ll end up in a job you love, so money-making will be bearable, but the emphasis was on fitting yourself into a job, rather than the other way around.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.” -Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been volunteering as a cat cuddler (yes that is as awesome as it sounds) and a dog walker at the local humane society. My responsibilities involve socializing the abandoned animals. Many people don&#39;t realize how hard it is for a dog or cat to be left behind or given away. The animal feels betrayed and can respond by becoming aggressive or exceedingly timid. It is so sad to see little puppies and kittens hiding scared, though they tend to rebound quickly and make new friends. The hardest thing is seeing an older animal too timid to come out of its cage.</description>

&lt;p&gt;All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sand pile at school. &lt;em&gt;- Robert Fulghum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children give you a lot of perspective on life. They are impossible to keep in order, except when you do seemingly trivial and silly things. They seem very rude and uncouth most of the time, but the best way to get them to do what you want is simply to ask nicely. They remind you what&#39;s important in life, and the importance of friends, food, and enough rest. They also teach you how to appreciate the little things in life, like the wonder of floating on a surfboard in the sun (something I find endlessly tedious) and how stupid things can be really, legitimately funny.</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most frustrating aspects of life is that whenever you become passionate about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/dont-be-afraid-to-reach-for-your-goals/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;pursuing some extraordinary goal&lt;/a&gt; or lifestyle, people waste no time in trying to hold you back. I find it odd that people rarely go out of their way to encourage your ambitions, but they will eagerly jump into a conversation to provide reasons you are wrong, might fail, or wasting your time. Especially if they have to change some aspect of their lives to accommodate you, they will do their utmost to convince you that your desire to run off and contribute to world peace will absolutely end their livliehoods.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;You scream, I scream, we all scream for ice cream!&#34; - American Proverb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream is probably the greatest food ever invented by humankind. But it is also probably one of the least healthy. It is basically milk and sugar, plus any flavorings and toppings. Of course, ice cream isn&#39;t meant to be healthy, so it should be an occasional treat, but sometimes you just have a craving for it when you know you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t break out the scoop and fudge sauce.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a repost of an article I wrote for another blog on career advice for young people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just have to do your own thing, no matter what anyone says. It&#39;s your life.” &lt;em&gt;- Ethan Embry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons out there why you would want to avoid a job like the plague. After all, there is a reason Robert Kiyosaki, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.wordpress.com/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, refers to the dreaded word as a mere acronym for &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;ust &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;ver &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;roke. Nevertheless, getting a job is the easiest way there is to make money, if not necessarily the most desirable, and as such is an invaluable method for providing the necessary foundation to jump off to freedom. Let’s be ridiculous and say we want a job with few hours, lots of freedom, and plenty of money. Where on earth do you find one like that? Before we go on, let me define what exactly I mean when I say Job.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.&#34; -&lt;em&gt;Dan Millman, The Peaceful Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the overriding themes that I refer to a lot is the idea that many important endeavors are ongoing. There is no end goal in mind, and having an end goal can often derail our efforts to improve. Instead, simply going through your routine, growing slowly and naturally, will get you where you want to go with less frustration and less pain.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My old school no longer plays dodgeball. It is against the rules. The children are urged to forget the game. In fact, we no longer play any games with a score, for fear of engendering competition. The fear is that kids will lord it over one another, put down the losers and gloat in their victory. They will brag and tease and ostracize their peers, or will feel hurt and put down. Some parents and administrators probably worry that kids who lose at dodgeball are more likely to do something violent to vent their frustration. I think this prevents kids from developing strong character.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Man&#39;s heart away from nature becomes hard.  &lt;em&gt;-Standing Bear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural world is all around us. Every city is merely an island of human habitation amidst a vast sea of countryside and forests. A mere hour outside of New York, one of the biggest metropolises in the world, one can find beautiful and surprisingly isolated parks and hiking trails. The hills around LA are still pretty wild (apparently coyotes are a major concern out there). Most cities have parks, little spaces where the city&#39;s fabric is cut out to reveal the nature underneath, just waiting to burst through into sunlight. These are places people can go to escape the hustle of the city for a while. There is something calming and serene about nature. I always feel complete and more balanced when surrounded by trees, and there is a lot to be said for seeking out a regular connection with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in college, drowning under the immense workload and the complexities of balancing my social life, personal life, and scholastic commitments, I stumbled upon a blog that saved my academic standing as well as my sanity. The blog is called Zen Habits, and it was a godsend.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Since I began CrossFit two years ago, I&#39;ve learned some things about fitness that seem very counterintuitive. When I started training other people, one of my biggest challenges had been convincing people that what they&#39;ve always thought about fitness is wrong. Here are some common misconceptions that I&#39;ve discovered to be false, along with some strange truths that you wouldn&#39;t suspect.</description>

      <title>How to Beat Procrastination</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Do it now! can affect every phase of your life. It can help you do the things you should do but don&#39;t feel like doing. It can keep you from procrastinating when an unpleasant duty faces you. But it can also help you do those things that you want to do. It helps you seize those precious moments that, if lost, may never be retrieved.” - &lt;em&gt;Napoleon Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my blog today, but I have to ask, is there something more important you have to do that you are putting off by checking in? (Or perhaps reading my blog is the most important thing you have to do today, in which case I&#39;m flattered :)). &lt;strong&gt;Procrastination, the sacred art of putting things off to the last minute, is one of the biggest productivity killers in our lives, and also one of the biggest sources of stress and anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a learned habit, one that can really mess with your sense of well-being and mental health. It cuts into all aspects of our lives, from reading, to shopping, to paying bills, to exercising. So why do we procrastinate, and how can we eliminate this habit?</description>

      <title>What Do You Call Yourself?</title>

&lt;p&gt;“They stick you with those names, those labels -- ‘rebel’ or whatever; whatever they like to use. Because they need a label; they need a name. They need something to put the price tag on the back of.” - Johnny Depp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask you what you do, what do you say? What would you like to say? Most people answer with their current job: &#34;I am a personal trainer,&#34; or &#34;I sell commodities,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m a homemaker.&#34; These sorts of answers are sufficient to move the conversation along, but most people &#39;do&#39; so much more than their job. Perhaps the question is actually a poorly worded version of, &#34;What is your job?&#34; I think that is only because of habit. I don&#39;t think most people care if you answer with your job or some other activity that occupies your time. So why not give an answer that really describes what it is you do?</description>

&lt;p&gt;This blog is largely about the development of character. The most important quality of character is integrity, because without it, character has no meaning. So what is integrity, anyway? The word is vaguely defined in most discussions, and looking back over my posts, I realize I have never actually clarified what it is I am talking about.</description>

&lt;p&gt;People have a lot of preconceived notions about what they deserve: what they deserve to be called, what they deserve to have, what they deserve to be paid, who they deserve to love and be loved by. We set limits on our own potential, not because we want to hold ourselves back, but rather because we think it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-we-love-the-status-quo/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;just way&lt;/a&gt;. The thought pattern might go like this: &#34;I&#39;ve only been writing regularly for a few weeks, so I don&#39;t deserve a published novel.&#34; &lt;strong&gt;Ironically, people often are afraid to reach for their goals, because they don&#39;t think they are worthy of them&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

      <title>Why You Should Blow it All to Travel</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that travel is essential to a complete education. Traveling abroad teaches understanding of other people, cultures and communities, and these types of experiences offer young people a greater ability to be successful in today&#39;s global society. &lt;em&gt;- Michael Palmer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old friend from my days interning at Forbes gave me some interesting advice today. As a well-established manager, she would have been able to make a very good argument for starting to seriously look at a career, putting down professional roots, building up my financial profile and really setting myself up for the long, steady path to independence and security. Instead, she pretty much recommended I risk it all and travel, try to work in some other countries, because, after all at my age and in this economic climate, there isn&#39;t much to lose. &lt;strong&gt;Take the big risks while you&#39;re young&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea is drunk to forget the din of the world. -T’ien Yiheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time finding ways to be healthier without dedicating huge chunks of time or money that I don&#39;t have. While a lot of the success I&#39;ve come across has been the result of some pretty big changes, I have found that the most basic and important things come from small changes. Increased energy levels, better sleep, better digestion, feeling calmer and more relaxed, less pain, and better relationships have all been the result of the smaller, cheaper alternations I&#39;ve made to my life. When these things fall off, problems occur. Here are some really small changes you can make to improve your life in noticeable ways.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Losses loom larger than corresponding gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you rather make $100 with a small possibility of losing $75 instead, or would you rather make $25 with no potential to lose anything? If you are like most people, you would select the second option. This despite the fact that there is potentially greater benefit to the first option. &lt;strong&gt;This is because people will rather hold on to what they have now than risk losing it for something better&lt;/strong&gt;. We worry that we&#39;ll never get back to what we had. This phenomenon is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Loss Aversion&lt;/a&gt; in the fields of decision-making and economics.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Listening</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about something, we just talk about something, just the positive or the negative side, without trying to express some intellectual, one-sided idea. And we listen without trying to figure out some intellectual understanding, without trying ot understand from just a one-sided view. &lt;em&gt;- Shunryu Suzuki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently wrote a Facebook note in which he mentioned some thoughts on conversations. Specifically, he maintained that it was better to have few conversations, because most people aren&#39;t very good at having conversations. Most people, states my friend, will be quick to follow random tangents in any discussion, never really making any headway on the issue you&#39;d like to discuss. In the end, they are more concerned with their own agenda than participating in the conversation at hand.</description>

      <title>Lessons on Friendship from Camp</title>

&lt;p&gt;We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have to share the same box -&lt;em&gt;Anon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of my childhood at a wonderful summer camp in Northern Minnesota, where it seemed like everyone was a potential friend and all the friends you made were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/best-friends-for-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;true friends&lt;/a&gt;. How great would that be in real life? So often the friends we make have agendas, or only hang around us at certain times and with certain people. There is often a sense of insincerity, or somewhat impure friendship. But at Summer Camp, the friends you made at horseback riding were just as good for sailing (assuming they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sail), and you could eat with them, camp with them, play games with them, or just sit and watch the lake together. There is a strange and wondrous ease about camp friends that is so rare and hard to find elsewhere.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth. To me, the function and duty of a quality human being is the sincere and honest development of one&#39;s potential. - Bruce Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I attended my first class of American Kenpo Karate in over five years. My old teacher told me in an e-mail to bring my old Gi, which I had kept, anticipating an eventual return to the art. When I went to dig it out from a trunk under my bed, I found my old belts, one soft, well-worn, and white, and the other stiff and bright, un-faded yellow. I grabbed the white belt and headed to class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stepped into the dance studio where the class was being held, my old instructor, taller and leaner than I remembered, looked at me without recognition. It &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;been a long time. He was shocked at the growth he saw in me and had trouble connecting the old Khaled with the one who stood before him. And then he looked down and saw I was wearing my old white belt and asked, &#34;Where&#39;s your belt?&#34;</description>

While drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things, barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the future -and we are incapable of actually living one minute of life. - Naht Hahn, &lt;em&gt;Miracle of Mindfulness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern technology is a wonderful thing. It gives us access to more information than we could possibly ever hope to read and understand. It connects us to people all over the world and lets us share ideas and conversations with them on a whim. It puts the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. As a college student, I was infinitely grateful for the fact that I could do almost all my research and class readings online without having to spend hours in the bookstacks looking for texts. At the click of a button, I could bring to my attention the latest psychological research and in the same breath skim an article on current events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.” - Frank Herbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to follow a very strict diet, and was religious about exercising. Rain or shine, groggy or energetic, sugar cravings or not, I followed my program. Ultimately, it turned out my particular program was a little intense and led to some problems, and so I have lately abandoned it for a more intuitive approach, meaning I do things when I feel like it, meaning I often don&#39;t do what I&#39;m supposed to do. At first, this felt liberating, but I&#39;ve begun to realize that I have given up something very important by letting go of my confining routines: my freedom.</description>

&lt;div&gt;“The only Zen you find on tops of mountains is the Zen you bring there” - Robert M. Pirsig&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I have lately started reading the very inspirational &lt;em&gt;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&lt;/em&gt;, by Shunryu Suzuki. This book is a collection of essays on Zen and it is both calming and enlightening to read. One of the overriding themes is the fact that Zen is not something external or alien to us. It already exists within us, in the nature of our minds, bodies, and spirits. Enlightenment is not found in some faraway spiritual realm, or even down the road. Rather, it is right there in your grasp. It is your grasp.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that some of my best decisions are made on a whim. That is, the less I consider a decision, the better it turns out. My worst decisions are made with a minimum of consideration, and I made decent choices after careful thought. But the things that make me happiest tend to be done with zero forethought.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; arrived in the mail. And right on the cover was a blurb about an article on &#34;The Organic Food Debate.&#34; I have some familiarity with the so called &#39;debate.&#39; It basically boils down to this: organic/clean/sustainable/local food is great in theory, but it is too expensive/elitist/not scalable. I have seen this sort of article several times, so I had a pretty good idea of the arguments to come, but I credit &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;with a willingness to tackle tough issues and the integrity to present ambivalent conclusions. So I turned to the page and started reading.</description>

      <title>Is Athleticism Good for Your Health?</title>

&lt;p&gt;A recent visit to my sports doctor, brought on by yet another overuse injury, prompted me to wonder if being an athlete is actually good for one&#39;s health and fitness. After all, the only reason I was at the doctor was because I am an athlete. I had injured my shoulder on a leisurely kayak tour of a small Connecticut lake. The shoulder was prone to such a pansy injury because I regularly engage in extreme fitness, aka, CrossFit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you are probably wondering, as was I, how can an athlete with shoulders capable of doing multiple strict muscle-ups be completely incapacitated by something as tame as kayaking? I honestly don&#39;t have an answer. But the experience got me to wondering about the distinctions between fitness, health, and athleticism.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I tend to get really sleepy around 9pm. This drives my friends crazy, since that is when they normally hang out, and it is about when I start thinking about turning in. They wonder why I&#39;m so energetically spent all the time, and my answer, ironically, is that it&#39;s because I exercise a lot. Besides that, I would explain that I have to get up at 5am a couple times a week, or 6:30 at the latest. This was an excuse I&#39;d use for myself as well, to justify my general desire to do less and sleep more. I just didn&#39;t have the energy to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I learned a lesson from a good friend, who actually recently joined my gym. He shows up to all my morning classes, and all the other morning classes, and &lt;em&gt;he &lt;/em&gt;is the one who is always trying to keep me up past 9pm. We were hanging out, late by my standards, and I was acting tired. When someone commented on it, I slipped into my usual explanation and my friend immediately jumped in to say that he got up at the same time every day. That shut me up pretty quick.</description>

      <title>A New Way to Run</title>

&lt;p&gt;Running is probably the most basic of human movements, besides walking. As an exercise, its benefits and usefulness are unparalleled. If I had to give up all but one mode of exercise, the one I&#39;d keep would be running in all its glorious manifestations: contemplative jogs, serene trail runs, tense hustles, heart-about-to-explode sprints. It is my favorite physical activity involving clothes (most of the time). Because it is so closely related to walking, we take to it pretty naturally. Nobody has to learn how to run in the way we learn how to swim or bike. You simply put one foot in front of the other, faster and faster and faster.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Our children don&#39;t inherit the Earth from us. We are borrowing it from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idealism can be a frustrating trait to have. You have such dreams and aspirations, most of which are far beyond your current capabilities. Once your acquire the means to realize your ambitions, you have become so reliant on the system you wanted to change that your idealism has faded to &#39;mature pragmatism.&#39; It is us young people that have so many concerns about living healthy, respecting and protecting the environment, giving our time to help our communities. But it is not until we are older that we have the resources to do that. Oftentimes, acquiring those resources, and the stability and time needed to dedicate those resources, comes at the cost of our activist-souls. As &lt;em&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad &lt;/em&gt;illustrates, we find ourselves shackled by a mortgage, a &#39;safe, secure job&#39;, and debt. Thoughts of changing the world are set aside as we struggle to simply get by. Eco-consciousness becomes something we do at the grocery store by &#39;buying green&#39;, and community engagement comes in the form of sending a monthly check to the neighborhood association you never interact with. You know cars are bad, but you&#39;ve got kids who need to get to soccer games, the grocery store is miles away, and the SUV is just so much more useful.</description>

Overall, it was a great movie, full of inspiring struggles to overcome adversity and useful advice about growing up and facing challenges. It also made an interesting comment on consumption patterns. And there were some awesome Kung Fu sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, in China, you must flip a switch to start preparing for a hot shower. The switch heats up the water, and when you&#39;re done taking your shower, you turn it off. It saves money and electricity, for obvious reasons. Jared&#39;s character doesn&#39;t understand this and asks, &#34;Why not just keep it on?&#34; Jackie Chan is surprised and appalled to discover that in America, we don&#39;t even have a switch. We just keep the hot water on all the time! He leaves Jared with this bit of advice: &#34;Get switch. Save money. Save the planet.&#34;</description>

      <description>A strange thing happened recently. My life went from being hectic, disorganized, and frustrating to suddenly clear and productive. This happened without any warning, and without any real discernible change in my circumstances. In the same way that you feel a lot lighter and calmer when you realize you&#39;ve been restricting your breathing and start taking deep breaths, something in my mindset that was cramped and tight simply relaxed.
This has had a number of interesting effects:</description>

People know this about me, and my parents have long encouraged the habit. As a result, I used to get a lot of writing-themed books as gifts. One particular type of book always made me feel inadequate as a writer: speciality dictionaries, full of strange and esoteric words (even more esoteric than &#39;esoteric&#39;) that a well-educated shaper of the English language ought to master and use in everyday speech. The problem was, I didn&#39;t really care to learn all these new words. So the books sat on my shelf, collecting dust, because I kept telling myself that, one day, I&#39;d get around to memorizing all these new, important words and incorporating them into my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m glad I never did.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the delay. Upon arriving home I discovered my home in the midst of packing to move and have thus been distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logistics from Hell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon leaving Wisconsin, I made my way, via bus, to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Even though I&#39;m not from the state, whenever anyone refers to &#39;the cities&#39; it is this metropolis I immediately think of, even when I&#39;m elsewhere. The bus ride was uneventful, except for the fact that I missed my first bus and then had to negotiate my way on to the next bus out. 5-minutes of lateness cost me $80 in new bus far and a taxi ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More logistical problems at the MSP airport prevented me from renting a car from my originally planned company. I thought I&#39;d be stuck completely but they recommended me to another company, which actually ended up costing me less. So it worked out in the end, I made it out of the cities and got on the long, beautiful, pine-wrapped highway of Minnesota, en route to the Northwoods and the lake country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson&lt;/strong&gt;: This was exactly the fear that had kept me from travelling in the first place. I dealt with it and got to the places I wanted to go. So I learned that I am smart enough and resourceful enough to manage if things go astray. Still, the reliance on my own cash was a little unsettling. What if I ran out of money? I have long ago stopped carrying Daddy&#39;s Credit Card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Memory Lane on I-35&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive up to camp was relaxing. I&#39;d been on the road all day anyway, but it was nice to drive my own (rented) car. I got up to camp around 11:30, feeling completely at home like always. I managed to find some people who knew me sharing a fire in the sailing house and sat with them for an hour, hanging out like we&#39;d been seeing each other all year. There was very little catch up talk and a lot of comfortable silence and random tangents. I slept in a cabin, all alone, which I should know by now is a bad idea. No matter how old I get, the intermediate cabins freak me out with all the windows open and their big, empty wooden rooms. I spent many a summer night as a kid bawling my eyes out in terror in those cabins, and old memories like that never really fade completely. While not afraid per se, I was unconsciously tense all night and didn&#39;t actually manage to fall asleep until the sun came up, lulled by the haunting call of the loon and the wind in the pines.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Midwest Trip Update</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_616&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Annie Mole on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/map.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-616 &#34; title=&#34;map&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/map.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for those of you who don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve been out travelling since Monday, reconnecting with all the places and as many people as I can that had an impact on me in the past year. I don&#39;t know why it was last year that made the difference, but I felt very much like there was a lot of loose ends to tie up. I&#39;m not at all sure what specifically those loose ends were, but they were there. So I finally just bought a ticket to Chicago and started my trip. Loose ends revealed themselves, and more importantly, methods for tying (or rather, connecting them to other, more integral threads) were slowly uncovered.</description>

      <title>Your Brain is Making You Weak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/brain.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-611&#34; title=&#34;brain&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/brain.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There&#39;s a lot in the fitness community on how diet and exercise impact fitness and strength, and even a fair amount on sleep. Less discussed is the impact of mental state and the way the nervous system can interact with muscles to have a huge impact on athletic performance and strength. Since I&#39;ve been reading some alternative theories lately, I thought I&#39;d share some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nervous Inhibition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an interesting fact: by default, the nervous system limits muscle tension to 30% of what the associated tendons can bear. So if you can only lift 100lbs, it&#39;s not because your muscles are weak, it&#39;s because your brain is holding you back to protect the tendons. Probably the biggest factor limiting how strong we are is our own nervous system keeping our muscles down to protect us. Another related phenomenon is that the brain will inhibit agonist (primary mover) muscles if it perceives the antagonist is weak, in order to protect the joint. For example, your bicep will be inhibited if your triceps is weak because the brain will worry that, should things get out of hand, the triceps won&#39;t be able to counteract the bicep force.</description>

Instead, I would like to do whatever I want, travelling, learning new skills, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/my-perfect-day/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pursuing my perfect day&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t want to rely on a job where I have to show up to be paid as my main source of income. I would like to be paid to exist. Or, more accurately, I would like to be paid as the result of some service that I provide without actually needing to be present so I can do whatever I want instead, owning a business or investments being the main vehicle for this sort of thing. Writing a book being another. We shall see. Read on to see my plan for accomplishing this.</description>

      <title>Why You Really Need to Clean Your Room</title>

Something about our natures necessitates living in filth and squalor, much to the chagrin of our parents, forced to visit and stay on our couch (unless they can afford a motel) or play host yet again as we struggle to find a job. The weird thing is, for a lot of us, we were actually pretty tidy back in the day. But now that we have our own place, why bother cleaning up? After all, I know exactly where my nice shirt is, even if that changes from day to day. It&#39;s not like our messy living spaces are unhygienic. A little inconvenient maybe, but it takes just as much time to clean and tidy as it does to search out our favorite pair of jeans.</description>

      <title>My Engine is Bigger than Yours: Efficiency vs. Effectiveness in CrossFit</title>

The less time it takes, the less effort involved, the better. Not so often do we ask ourselves whether we&#39;re doing the right task or not. Is what we are doing actually the most effective way to reach our goals, or is it just busy-work? A Honda is more efficient than a Ferrari, but a Ferrari will get your where you&#39;re going much, much faster, making it more effective if your goal is saving time in transit.</description>

The main character Ryan Bingham, played by the masterful (and distressingly handsome) George Clooney, is in love with his unattached life. Unburdened by attachments to people, place, or things, he revels in travel and the complete freedom he has. During the movie, he begins to question his life, however, and contemplates something like a commitment to another person. Turns out that he can&#39;t really be a part of another person&#39;s &#39;real life,&#39; and we are left wondering if his entire existence is composed of &#39;in betweens,&#39; or at least whether or not he is capable of functioning except when he is up in the air.</description>

      <title>Is Facebook controlling who your friends are?</title>

In some cases, they are people I don&#39;t even enjoy being around in person, but are nevertheless fun and interesting to talk to in the sterile little chat box. This got me to thinking about how the mediums we use for social interaction affect that interaction. I&#39;m certainly more flirtatious online than in person, but what if the effects go deeper than tone?</description>

&lt;p&gt;As an athlete, one of the most common de-motivators I deal with is the assertion, made either by myself or well-meaning friends trying to help me deal with frustration at limited progress, that professional and Olympic athletes (those I aspire to be like) are genetic abnormalities. Thus, I should not expect myself to perform at their level, and should not hold myself to similar expectations of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I have agreed with this statement. After all, I&#39;m just a genetically average human, right? Even with all the determination in the world (and I have plenty of that) I just don&#39;t have the right bone length, muscle fiber ratios, metabolic eccentricities, to make it to the big leagues. So I shouldn&#39;t even try, and certainly not become frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized I have no idea what my genetic make-up is. For all I know, I am an Olympic sprinter who just needs the right training to unleash his genetic potential. People tell me I&#39;m too tall to be a gymnast, too lanky to be a good lifter, but there have been unlikely champions in every sport imaginable.</description>

If I had my way, I&#39;d require all children to be educated on the importance of the natural world, at the expense of more &#39;practical&#39; subjects, but I tend to maintain some distance from most environmental issues, simply because they tend to be so heartbreaking, with so many angry people on both sides. To get emotionally involved would be like asking for a stress-induced heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I read an article in Time about the Deep Horizon disaster. I had known what was going on, but was not aware of the extent of the damage. Reading it was like watching a horror movie; it was so horrific I wanted to cover my eyes, but something compelled me to keep reading, to subject myself to the terrible scenes and let the images of the ecological disaster crowd my mind. I felt my heart grow cold with fear for all the environmental damage that would and has occurred, all the diversity that would be lost and perhaps never recovered. I felt anger at the people who had allowed this to happen: the oil companies and our government. But most of all, I felt a deep sadness. How terrible that our civilization has come to this habit of destroying its most beautiful environments and coastlines for the sake of a few more years of dirty, smoggy convenience.</description>

We get to spend the next four years discovering our interests academically, finding our social niche, and figuring out our professional futures so that when we graduate...we still have no idea what we want to do with our lives. The problem is multi-faceted, but hinges on the fact that college is not a reflection of the real world. The subjects are not applied as they would be, the social life is completely unique, and the reward system does not reflect how people find fulfillment outside of college. Furthermore, there is a lot of pressure in college to do what is best for our academic or professional future, and too often the focus is on short term requirements to meet various grant or internship criteria, not personal happiness.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We all have times in our lives when we find ourselves unable to do the things we love, often because we did too much of the things we love. Whether it&#39;s cutting back on delicious pies because we had too many in one sitting last winter or cutting back our training load because we hurt ourselves, we get ourselves into situations that we regret, doing something we knew we shouldn&#39;t have done at the time, but did anyway.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked who the people in the canoe on the top banner are. It&#39;s no surprise that one of them is me. The other person is a guy who has been like a brother to me since fifth grade, when I stumbled awkwardly on to the shores of this country, a naive Arab with no clue how to handle this overwhelming America, as it were. He took me under his wing, and attempted (in vain) to teach me the ways of the American schoolboy. Since then, we&#39;ve been through almost everything together: we&#39;ve gotten to the point of mutual hatred, we&#39;ve come to appreciate the man-hug, we got our Eagle Scout badges at the same time and held a joint ceremony, we&#39;ve SCUBA dived together, and undertaken the most sacred of modern manly bonding rituals: Playing through Halo&#39;s Co-op Campaign on Legendary difficulty. He was my inspiration to get better at video games, and sports, and we&#39;ve been up until 3 AM countless times arguing the finer points of moral philosophy.</description>

&lt;h2&gt;Predawn Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up just before dawn, energized and alert, in a house I built, and throw on a handmade parka before heading out the door barefoot and going for an early morning jog through the forest, which is only a few hundred yards from my front door. The air is damp but cool. I jog about ten minutes to my favorite rock overlooking a valley, facing the rising sun, where I sit and meditate as the sun comes up. I&#39;m cold, but it doesn&#39;t bother me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jogging back, I stop on the way to feed the chickens and the goats wandering the yard. The dog is awake by now, but not the rest of the family, and he comes out to help me rouse the animals, playfully yipping at the goats and nudging the sleepy hens. While I&#39;m out, I check the nests for eggs for breakfast. I finish tending to the animals and head inside to start preparing breakfast for the kids and the wife.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m qualified to define a morality for all young people, or even why I care so much. I figure it&#39;s as much for myself as for others. I don&#39;t know why it gets harder to achieve your potential after childhood, how to balance pragmatism and idealism, when high standards bleed into obsessive perfectionism. I don&#39;t know if anything I say applies to girls, or why more girls comment on what I write even though the image of a warrior is masculine to me.</description>

In this game, the main character, Kratos, begins the game as the recently appointed god of war, replacing Ares. He has all sorts of powers, wears nifty armor, and has a lot going on in his life. But he is not satisfied. Then, Zeus betrays him. There is a scene of Kratos&#39; armor falling apart, leaving him with nothing but a loincloth, some boots, and his weapons, which is the state he goes through most of the game in. He has a single purpose at that point: to enact vengeance on Zeus. Kratos is a relatively small guy, as far as Greek heroes go - in a face off with Theseus, the Thebian towers over Kratos. Most of Kratos&#39; enemies are decked out in fancy armor, carry ridiculous weapons (usually turned on them by the plucky Spartan), and have access to all sorts of assistance and special powers. Kratos is a minimalist. He powers his way through his environment, using his physical strength and his mental cunning, two simple blades, and little else.</description>

      <title>How I Find Time to Write</title>

I&#39;ve felt the consequences. My readership has declined, and I feel like my writing style has gotten a little stiff from lack of flexing. Writing has always been a hugely important part of my life. Not only is it an artistic means to express myself, it has always been associated with periods of balance in my life; when I&#39;m writing regularly, my mind and spirit are in order, and a lot of other things as well. When I can&#39;t find the time to write, things slowly come apart at the seams. I don&#39;t really know why this is. Perhaps writing is how I parse my jumbled thoughts into discrete, comprehensible units called words and sentences, which I can then manipulate and act on in my life. Without taking the time to do this, my thoughts and ideas just fill to the brim and overflow in a messy jumble of psychic disorder. Writing is a form of meditation, a kind of waking dreaming for me.</description>

Such is the case with job offers. I was recently offered a position at Forbes, where I have been helping out on the social media team in exchange for experience. I very much appreciated the offer, and my first instinct was to immediately accept. But I had made other commitments that I didn&#39;t feel entirely comfortable walking away from on such short notice. So I declined the offer. I&#39;ve gotten reactions ranging from disbelief, to surprise, to admiration, to declarations of my stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to be competitive for college, we fill our transcripts with a crazy variety of activities: math club, Boy Scouts, flying lessons, karate, cross country, guitar, piano lessons. This is in addition to our classes, which tend to cover a wide range of subjects: precalc, biology, English, painting. Then in college, we start off with a fairly broad range of topics to study, and as we move towards our major, the subjects narrow down to one or two: psychology and international studies of the Middle East. Then, after college, we get a job and are expected to become experts in one single field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to consider myself a renaissance man, with interests in a wide range of activities, but I&#39;m not so sure anymore. After all, I spend so much of my time studying fitness and in training. My conversations with people tend to gravitate towards talk about health, fitness, and nutrition. Last night while bartending,  a guy at the bar wanted to watch the NFL draft, and I had no clue how to have a conversation with him. I never really followed or understood football, but it made be wonder if I&#39;m either out of touch with society or simply too narrow in my interests.</description>

You&#39;d think that making it to regionals would give me a message that I have some potential, and that I should work hard to realize it. Instead, I feel oppressed by the prospect of competing again. All my training is geared towards this one event, an event that has a very narrow definition of success (even by the standards of CrossFit), and in which I will undoubtedly be one of the smallest, puniest, guys there. Maybe I&#39;m over-dramatizing here, but I definitely feel like an underdog - I&#39;m young, relatively weak (most guys at these things can deadlift 400+ lbs, I&#39;m around 315lb on a good day), and pretty inexperienced. If it&#39;s all about who can move the most weight, I&#39;m screwed.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Persistence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/penguin.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-489&#34; title=&#34;penguin&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/penguin.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;222&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, the workout at my gym was to determine at what weight you could do 10 non-stop power cleans (move a barbell from floor to shoulder in one motion). At 165lbs, my form began to slip and I dragged the knurled bar up my shins, several times, leaving my legs bloody and stinging. I failed the set, only getting 9. Pretty upset with myself, I went to the bathroom to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was taping up my leg, I was thinking about calling it a day. But looking at my leg, I realized there wasn&#39;t any actual damage. All I&#39;d done was scrape some skin, and while it stung, it had no impact on my muscles&#39; ability to perform. I covered the wound in tape to protect it, and got back on the pad, and did the full set as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of times in our lives when we suffer dramatic and painful failures. Our usual response is to throw in the towel, grudgingly accept that we did our best, and nurse our wounded egos. But when we look back, it is clear that our egos were the only things that were really injured by our setback. Our ability to complete the task at hand has not been diminished in any way, we simply have decided, arbitrarily, that we have failed.</description>

In my conception of my future were two warring images of my adult self. One was an extremely independent explorer/traveler/innovator who set his own schedule, had plenty of free time, and an inexplicable, substantial source of monetary income. The other image was one of a diligent, creative and hardworking member of a larger organization with an obvious source of substantial income and less free time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/countryside.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-478&#34; title=&#34;countryside&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/countryside.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have an interesting relationship with the sustainable food community. I am deeply passionate about it, but I have never actually been a part of it. I can practically come to tears reading Mother Earth News and get lost in stories about people raising heritage chickens, constructing their own homes,, tending gardens, living in harmony with nature and experiencing a familial closeness that few Americans ever experience anymore. But I have never done any of these things. I think I grew some bean sprouts once in elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this apparent lack of connection, every time I read these stories or talk with people who live these lives, I feel an unmistakable sense of nostalgia. It seems strange to feel nostalgic for something I&#39;ve never experienced, but I strongly &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; these things. I miss raising chickens, I miss knowing the names of the trees and what they are good for, I miss being in tune with the seasons. It is as if a quiet part of me, long dormant, stirs every time it hears something related to how things used to be. There is a spiritual connection to that life of harmony that is so powerful in me it almost hurts to live a life that is not in accordance to its desires. But where did it come from? Has it always been there, as a primordial connection to the land and community inherent in all humans? Or is it something that grew in me in response to the decay I see in our disharmonious world and the hope offered by a return to a different lifestyle whose values so closely mirror my deepest ideals?</description>

      <description>I just got back from two days of the most intense physical and mental challenges of my life, the CrossFit Northeast Sectionals, the first step on the road to the 2010 CrossFit games, the winners of which are considered the fittest man and woman on Earth.
I&#39;m too tired right now to write a detailed play-by-play, so right now, I just want to share some thoughts.
I was certainly one of the smaller guys going into this competition, and I have only been CrossFitting for a little over a year.</description>

      <description>This past week has been pretty hard on everyone in Southwestern Connecticut. My dad and I had a little adventure of our own, which I wanted to share, not so much because I want people to know as because I want to write it down somewhere. This blog has become my journal, so here it is.
Just a Regular Day in Connecticut Around mid-afternoon last Saturday, our power went out. My mom had just pulled a chicken out of the oven, and was braising a boar loin, so we were pretty upset at the inconvenience, but weren&#39;t especially concerned.</description>

The other Stamford-based CrossFit gym, Hybrid Fitness, believes that extreme strength is pretty much the fundamental requirement for a good athelete. As such, they utilize a lot of strongman programming and training. We do not, and generally we aren&#39;t as strong on average. Does that mean we are worse than them?</description>

All they can do is remind themselves that they will be spared the debilitating chronic diseases that will likely afflict their less-disciplined friends. Unfortunetly (or not) it isn&#39;t that simple. Sometimes, those of us with the healthiest of habits end up the victim while our chain smoking, sugar-munching friends live their whole lives without the smallest issues.</description>

Basically, my dilemma is this: should I invest my time and money in looking stylish and thus promoting myself socially, potentially leading to financial and personal success as a result of my social finesse, or should I spare the environment and my checkbook by only buying functional, practical, and minimal clothing?</description>

The author undertook to learn the ways of pickup artists for a year, ended up becoming one of the greatest pickup artists in the world (according to an internal rating), developed his own system, and eventually stepped out. He then wrote a book about his experiences, triggering a massive outpouring of additional pickup methods, books, how-to&#39;s, workshops, dating coaching seminars, etc.</description>

      <title>Warrior Profile: Comparing Batman and Spiderman</title>

      <description>I talk a lot about Batman as an inspiration for training and following ideals, so just for fun, I thought I&#39;d write a post on how exactly the Path of the Warrior can be discerned from his life. To make things more interesting, I will be comparing him to another popular superhero: Spiderman. I picked these two because a) they are very nearly opposites without one being a villain, and b) there were recently made several movies about each.</description>

      <title>Epic Fail</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/failure.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-438&#34; title=&#34;failure&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/failure.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;201&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, I failed epically. The workout for today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many rounds as possible, in 10 minutes, of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 deadlifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 hang cleans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 front squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 push jerks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All with 95 lbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it&#39;s a ton of work, and much of it involving very technical movements. I was aiming to complete 7 rounds (so 49 of everything) because the previous record was 6 and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed 6 rounds with about a minute and a half left. I was already dying. My vision was blurry and my legs felt like jelly, but I pushed through the sets. I got to the push jerks with 30 seconds left and without taking any rest, started into them. As the clock ticked to 0 seconds, I became distanced from my body, aware of but not feeling the burning in every muscle (a sensation that I had never experienced before), until the very last rep.</description>

When I was in elementary school, I was emulating my idea of what responsible adults acted like, rather than trying to grow up to be like the high school kids. I didn&#39;t look forward to high school and college as times to party and sleep around, but instead as opportunities to start developing the skills and qualities I wanted to use as the foundation of my life as a responsible, formidable man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends thought I was weird, and I thought I had made a huge mistake. I still wonder if I wouldn&#39;t have been better off just going with the flow and enjoying myself, instead of trying so hard to grow up.</description>

An old friend sent me a link to a really profound article yesterday. The article is an interview with a Pueblo-turned-Mayan-shaman, Martin Prechtel. In the interview Prechtel discusses his relationship with the spiritual world of indigenous cultures that have a respect for, and connection to, the land and environment around them. He also draws some really ominous connections between the utter lack - some would say, outright denial - of spirituality in Western civilization and the cultural malaise we experience in the form of endemic depression, poverty, loneliness, and even physical ailment.</description>

      <title>The Ties That Bind</title>

&lt;p&gt;In my path down alternative fitness and nutrition and spirituality, I&#39;m discovering that members of my various communities all seem to agree on certain things. Most CrossFitters tend to agree that we should move as our bodies were meant to, and often think in terms of evolutionary biology and anatomy. This parallels a similar trend in the local and traditional food community to look back to how our ancestors ate to determine the best way to eat now. In fact, the CrossFitters also extend this mentality to nutrition, and I&#39;m sure many traditional foodies would as well if fitness were as central to their lives as nutrition is to a CrossFitter&#39;s.</description>

A number of my fellow CrossFitters didn&#39;t make it all the way though. The same attitude that gets them through grueling workouts is now making them very frustrated with themselves and their perceived inability to stick to a simple diet plan. They can&#39;t understand why a slice of toast is more difficult to overcome than a 250lb barbell.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are some jobs you would do regardless of whether you were paid or not. And then there are some jobs you would only do if you were paid. I&#39;m a little shocked and terrified at the number of people who are paid to perform the functions necessary to making our civilization run, who perform jobs I can&#39;t imagine spending eight years of my life doing. I am torn between admiration for their ability to keep upbeat and cheerful and pity at the sheer tedium of their jobs. But we all have to make a living.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Humility</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/traits-of-a-warrior-humility/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/traits-of-a-warrior-humility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/humility.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-407&#34; title=&#34;humility&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/humility.jpg?w=210&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons I&#39;ve learned from CrossFit is humility. Workouts that sound easy never are, and I am always amazed at how quickly my muscles will tire, how a weight that sounds light quickly becomes unbearable. To make things worse, we are always talking about how some crazy CrossFitter completed the same WOD in unrealistically fast times. CrossFit is a community, and so we know that the same workout that destroyed everyone at our gym was a walk in the park for someone else. Personally, this is hard to swallow. I know I&#39;ve made amazing strides since I started, but an unweighted barbell still gets painfully heavy after a few minutes, and burpees can still leave me begging for mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, I&#39;ve come to learn that getting frustrated does not make things any better. After 5 months of training, my snatch max hasn&#39;t changed a single pound. But trying to use frustration to motivate myself only causes my technique to fall apart. There is a fine line between determination and frustration.</description>

      <title>Food and the Way of the Warrior</title>

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post a lot of talk about food and healthy eating on this blog, so you may be wondering what food has to do with the Warrior lifestyle. After all, it is such a mundane topic. Wouldn&#39;t our time be better spent discussing mental attitudes or physical training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food is important to a Warrior lifestyle because it is the basis of our physical existence. Food is used to contruct our bodies, and to fuel them. In order to be of service to others, and for her own happiness, a Warrior should seek to cultivate and maintain a healthy body. As much as we may deny it, we exist in the physical realm, and so must look after our physical existence to build a strong foundation for our endeavors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I used to do a lot of website design, not because I enjoy writing code, but because I like creative design. For me, there is a lot of pleasure to be had in discerning the best layouts for a page, the colors used to emphasize certain areas and ideas, the interplay of pictures and content in bringing your page to life. I was fairly well-versed in coding techniques as well, and was self-taught in HTML, CSS, and even a little JavaScript. I actually would get pretty involved in the technical side of things just to make a particular button or layout work the way I wanted it to in a clean, efficient manner. But set me down to write a piece of code with the express purpose of calculating and out putting some value and I’ll just fall asleep. For me, the allure is in the artistic possibility, the connection between the technical and the aesthetic. I find it fascinating how manipulating the very dry and cold elements of HTML and CSS code can produce a work of art. The process is very different than that of working with a brush, in which your actions translate directly to the art being produced. In web design, you are a step removed from your creation.</description>

Sent out dozens of applications, trolled family contacts, bugged family friends, tried my hand at insurance, utilized alumni connections, everything I could think of. I don&#39;t even know how many Craigslist ads I responded to (in quite a bit of detail I might add). I went through a long and intense interview process for a job that would have set me down an amazing career in diplomacy and provided an astounding starting salary, only to be told eventually I lacked experience. My hopes have been dashed against the rocks more times than I want to count, but, with nothing else to do, I kept at it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;People ask me why I train so hard. The answer is simple. I&#39;m training to be Batman... (as Superman was technically an alien, it would be a bit ridiculous for me to train to be him, since there&#39;s no way I could ever achieve that level of strength and fitness as an Earthling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My CrossFit coaches have offered to pay my registration fee for the New England CrossFit Sectionals in March. While those who know me can attest to the fact that I didn&#39;t really need much motivation to train hard in the past, going to the Sectionals has given me a new kind of motivation and intensity to train. Knowing that I am going to be competing against some of the fittest people in New England, many of them bigger and stronger than me, has gotten me to really kick my training into high gear.</description>

      <description>The sustainable food blog, Farm to Table, has recently been declared a failure by its creator. The initial goal, to set up a foundation for a TV show, did not produce results, and so he has decided to cut his losses and pursue another (really interesting) project. Never one to let things lie, I offered to take over and take Farm to Table in a new direction.
So now I am the editor of Farm to Table, responsible for setting its direction and collaborating with the 1,000 or so followers.</description>

      <description>I just heard a report on the radio of a new (2 years) tentative eating disorder called orthorexia, an unhealthy obsession with only eating healthy foods. First of all, I&#39;d just like to say, that sounds ridiculous. Second, I believe it.
Orthorexia can cause problems because sufferers frequently go hungry, choosing to starve rather than eat foods they deem unhealthy. Symptoms include trying out various (so called extreme) diets such as veganism, raw foodism, etc.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just finished Tom Wolfe&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&amp;lt;iframe src=&amp;quot;http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;t=warrspir-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;amp;asins=0312424442&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;width:120px;height:240px;&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; marginwidth=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; marginheight=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; &#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I am Charlotte Simmons&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a disturbingly accurate depiction of modern American college life. The book is set in the fictional Ivy League University of Dupont, in Pennsylvania, and follows the first year of high school prodigy Charlotte Simmons. Charlotte, having won every award conceivable in high school, arrives at college with high expectations but finds herself overwhelmed by a world that cares more about social standing than academic achievement.</description>

      <description>Just found this interestging article in Times online, entitled, &#34;Does Facebook Replace Face Time or Enhance It?&#34; Considering I write a blog, which i share on Facebook and Twitter and which has engendered intersting duscussion at times, I thought I&#39;d comment.
The gist of the article is a dilemma between whether Facebook causes people to avoid interacting in real time or if it improves their real life relationships. The author describes his relationship with an old friend, which has degenerated to the point where she hasn&#39;t returned a phone call in over a year, but has poked him, sent him facebook gifts, and interacted in the various mini-games and applications on Facebook.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently reading Tom Wolfe&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I am Charlotte Simmons, &lt;/em&gt;a magnificently detailed and richly described look at American college life. One of the main characters, Hoyt, is at the top of the college social ladder, a frat boy. His big claim to fame is the accidental witnessing of the visiting governor of California in a compromising situation, and a subsequent confrontation with the governor&#39;s bodyguard. The bodyguard challenged Hoyt and his friend, but instead of backing down, Hoyt took the question seriously, responding to the bodyguard &#34;what do you two think you&#39;re doing?&#34; with an honest answer. His confidence in his right to be there caught the bodyguard off guard, getting him angry enough to attack the boys, to his ultimate detriment.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</title>

      <description>I recently completed the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert M. Pirsig, which, contrary to its name, is not a book about Zen or motorcycle maintenance, except in a very roundabout way.
The book is set in the motorcycle roadtrip of a father, the narrator, and his son, Chris, but the real meat of the book is contained in a series of chataquas, or talks, investigating a philosophical conundrum central to Western thought.</description>

Glover, adds to the growing conversation on masculinity in our society. Blogs like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://artofmanliness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Art of Manliness&lt;/a&gt;, the renewed interest in old-school shaving, the death of the metrosexual (maybe? hopefully) are all part of the movement to reclaim what it means to be a real man. Gover&#39;s book is an important contribution to that movement because it addresses one of the biggest stumbling blocks that recovering pansies have to deal with: the misperception that being a Nice Guy will get you anywhere in life.</description>

      <title>How to Get a Job, and Charisma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of my fellow college graduates, I&#39;ve been trying very hard to get a job in the past few months. And I spent the last month interviewing for one specific job that seemed like the perfect job for me right now. It paid a great salary, let me contribute to a cause I really cared about, was in New York City, where I want to live, and would utilize my skills and provide me with a lot of opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a month and a half in the interview process, got called back twice, spent about $100 in train fare, spent hours crafting writing samples, researching the field and interview techniques, cultivating relevant connections, and going beyond what I was asked...and I was refused. My theory is that I should not have shaved my beard.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since starting this blog, I have constantly run into the problem of how honest to be with my readers. My parents are constantly asking me to tone down certain things, to refrain from sharing personal details of my life I think are important to understanding my thought process. I don&#39;t really know where to draw the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation the other day with a friend who works in advertising. She is very supportive of my blogging, and every time I come up with an interesting idea, she encourages me to blog it, to share it with the world. My latest idea was somewhat risque, to put it lightly, but she said that was precisely the point. By being open and honeset about the truth of my life, I would be able to achieve a degree of integrity in my intellectual and emotional life that had eluded me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in the midst of reading &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance &lt;/em&gt;by Robert M. Pirsig&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and the author spends a lot of time talking about the educational system in the United States, indeed, all of Western civilization. As a recent college graduate, this is something I&#39;ve actually questioned a lot myself. I don&#39;t know about most of my peers, but I never really thought of college as a necessity, or even a forgone conclusion. When I applied to college, I did it in the context of an expectation - I went to a college-prep school and was at the top of my class, everybody at that school expected me to go to college - but I personally did not necessarily want to go to college. I chose to go, consciously, because I was convinced that it would help me achieve my goals. I did, however, entertain other options.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, Warriors have been the guardians of their societies. They do not train and fight for the sake of it, or for senseless violence. Historical warriors have learned the arts of war in order to better protect their people and families, or to extend their reach of their chosen sovereign. Tribal warriors were the ones who put their lives on the line to defend their families. Knights and Samurai were the ones willing to die for their lords&#39; agenda.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m finally back from Switzerland (actually, I&#39;ve been back a while, but these posts have been backlogged), and I have come back a changed man, though I didn&#39;t realize I was changing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to Europe, I was not especially concerned about my ability to eat healthy, because I know the Swiss are very protective about the quality of their food. Staying in shape seemed like it might be a challenge, and the school gym proved pretty disappointing, but the Swiss have a reputation for lifelong hardiness, so I figured I&#39;d absorb something through the mountain air. My biggest concern was fitting in with my sister&#39;s crowd. She has regaled me with stories of crazy nights out late at bars and dance clubs, which are not normally my favored scene.</description>

      <description>Lia and I went to Florence last weekend. I had never been to Italy, and I thought, since I&#39;m in Europe, I might as well go see the country that fostered one of the world&#39;s greatest empires (so my decision was heavily influenced by watching too many episodes of Rome).
Florence was a beautiful, crowded, lively city with narrow windy streets shared equally with cars and pedestrians. Random piazzas dominated by massive cathedrals and palazzos punctuated the city, setting the tone for each area.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This evening, I had dinner two friends of mine. The conversation with one was inspiring and empowering. The conversation with the other was considerably less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One purpose of this dinner was to talk about a potential job I am looking into, working for Arab-Israeli peace. Perhaps the most ridiculously idealistic endeavor anyone could undertake in this world. And that was my second friend&#39;s opinion. The position of the organization I&#39;ve been looking at is that there is a moderate position, that it is a widespread position, and that there are enough Arabs and Israelis willing to accept it. My second friend expressed his opinion that this was unrealistic, and that there was too much history and too much animosity on both sides to enable any sort of reconciliation. Needless to say, he was not too excited about my new opportunity.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;I never think about ways to quit or lose. I only think about what I need to do to win!&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Bill Whittle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the weekend at a Primerica event in Parsippony, NJ, listening to the ideas and motivational life philosophies of Bill Whittle, the third highest earner in the company and one of the most successful men in the business. The great thing about Primerica is that so much of the business, which focuses on enabling individuals to achieve financial independence, is about personal growth, rather than business strategy or money-making techniques.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of posts on the attributes that make up this character we&#39;re referring to as a Warrior. These are the things that I seek to embody in how I live, the most important aspects of the men and women who seek to challenge injustice in society and who seek to bring about change. For that is what being a Warrior is all about: fighting the good fight, whether that be in the political arena, the social sphere, or the battlefield.</description>

      <description>I did a lot of growing this past summer, and a lot of that growth was directed by some very, very good books. These have come up at least once in every serious conversation I&#39;ve had since then, so I thought I&#39;d post some explanation for the benefit of my friends who keep hearing about them. Each of these books has undeniably changed the way I think about life, for the better, widening my perspective or giving me the mental tools to better understand and grasp certain aspects of life.</description>

      <description>In my CrossFit research, I recently came across a CFJ article in which Dr. Barry Sears, the founder of the Zone Diet, explains how it impacts athletic performance. Since it is the diet endorsed by CrossFit, it is not surprising that it improves athletic performance. What is interesting is that it is contrary to traditional notions of athletic diets.
Most athletes, especially endurance athletes, who are not trying to lose weight, will either eat anything they want (because they just burn it off) or maintain a very high carb to protein ratio, gorging on pasta and granola.</description>

      <description>All Hallow&#39;s Eve was spent introducing my old high school friend to the Wii while answering the doorbell for trick or treaters. Kids these days have apparently developed a sense of entitlement. Doorbell rings, I open door, they stick out their bags and grab candy. No &#34;trick or treat&#34; no &#34;Happy Halloween&#34;, just give me candy. To be fair, a few of them actually went through the ritualistic greeting. We even had one kid ask to use our bathroom, but it turned out we had no toilet paper stocked so he just left.</description>

      <description>I have noticed, in my path to attain some proficiency in high-level fitness, that there is an assumption that you need a lot of gimmicky science to get really good at anything. If you want to gain a lot of muscle, there best way to do it is to chug a &#39;specially formulated&#39; protein shake after every workout, which itself is systematic and &#39;specially formulated&#39; to give you maximum results with minimum effort.</description>

      <description>Problem-solving Process  Spend some time with the problem &amp;ldquo;What would make this easy?&amp;rdquo; Make it like something familiar Make it concrete Test Look for shortcuts and refine  What worked? Why? Can it be combined with something else or consolidated? What didn&amp;rsquo;t work? Why? Do I need that? Can we bypass the problem entirely? What should be changed to improve? Is that feasible? Repeat with a smaller version of the big cycle.</description>
