      <description>Project Notebook Github, includes STL
Final Demo  Goal The goal of this project was to build a sunrise simulation lamp using an Arduino and a Neopixel ring. This is essentially a proof of concept, since I would probably want to use a much bigger Neopixel ring for a real lamp. This one also has a real-time clock board (RTC) that enables the device to keep time even when the Arduino is not drawing power.</description>

      <description>This is a project to use a Raspberry Pi to stream games from my CLX gaming PC to various locations in the house using Parsec.
Software Getting the Raspberry Pi to act as a streaming solution wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as the instructions from Parsec indicated. The biggest issues we faced (I did this with my friend Sam Cipriani) were latency from attempting to stream a graphics intensive application into the Pi, and then output that onto a big, high resolution TV screen.</description>
