      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; was first released, I was so excited to read about quick, easily applied shortcuts to &#39;improve&#39; my life and my body. How could I resist the promise of becoming superhuman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I tried to apply the habits, none of them stuck. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t work, but they were hacks, not part of a cohesive lifestyle, and hacks are not meant to be permanent or sustainable. The &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; in particular reads like a recipe book: you pick your abilities, like building a character in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Lifehacking applied to people, and while the allure was irresistible, it felt hollow.</description>
