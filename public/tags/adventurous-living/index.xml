&lt;p&gt;When I started learning gymnastics, I wasn&#39;t the only adult at the gym. But I was the only adult on the rings and I was the only person there with no formal gymnastics experience as a child (excluding the Parkour crowd and one other guy who had started in college).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my previous experience, my age, and my chosen apparatus of still rings, there weren&#39;t many who thought I would go far. After all, there weren&#39;t many (if any) who had come into gymnastics late with the intent of picking up much beyond tumbling and flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my coach and I moved slowly, exploring different ways to progress and learn that might be unique to my situation. Every training session was an adventure, because I didn&#39;t know anyone who had done what I was trying to do. I didn&#39;t know what to expect, or how I would ultimately fare.</description>
