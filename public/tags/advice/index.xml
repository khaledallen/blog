&lt;p&gt;In reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The 80/20 Principle&lt;/a&gt;, I undertook some exercises recommended by the author to identify my &#39;happiness islands&#39; and my &#39;achievement islands&#39;, times in my life when I was especially happy or productive. The pattern that emerged was that I have been especially productive when I&#39;m either working for myself or have the freedom to set my own agenda and goals. My happiness is also strongly correlated with my independence.</description>

      <title>How I Find Time to Write</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/typewriter.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-516&#34; title=&#34;Old typewriter help&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/typewriter.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I know that lately, I haven&#39;t been posting as regularly as Â I used to. I&#39;ve felt the consequences. My readership has declined, and I feel like my writing style has gotten a little stiff from lack of flexing. Writing has always been a hugely important part of my life. Not only is it an artistic means to express myself, it has always been associated with periods of balance in my life; when I&#39;m writing regularly, my mind and spirit are in order, and a lot of other things as well. When I can&#39;t find the time to write, things slowly come apart at the seams. I don&#39;t really know why this is. Perhaps writing is how I parse my jumbled thoughts into discrete, comprehensible units called words and sentences, which I can then manipulate and act on in my life. Without taking the time to do this, my thoughts and ideas just fill to the brim and overflow in a messy jumble of psychic disorder. Writing is a form of meditation, a kind of waking dreaming for me.</description>
