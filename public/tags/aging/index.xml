&lt;p&gt;Remember in Bambi how much of a wimp Bambi was as a young buck? Compared to his father, the king of the forest, he was still just a whelp, even though technically a fully grown deer. His father, on the other hand, was a fully mature stag, quite literally an embodiment of the spirit of the forest. How often do we see out own parents that way: at the peak of their power, rather than in decline?</description>
