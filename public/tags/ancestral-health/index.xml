      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/7478267850_38dff958ff.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2396&#34; title=&#34;Optimistic Flower&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7478267850_38dff958ff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;334&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I am an optimist. It does not seem too much use being anything else. - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans break down. This is an accepted truth. Eventually (all too soon), we lose function. We become decrepit, slow, weak, riddled with pain, and ugly. Instead of crystallizing our wisdom &lt;a title=&#34;Aging Gloriously&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/aging-gloriously/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;, our minds decay. Injuries do not heal, at least not without external intervention, and the greatest triumph of humankind is the medical and pharmaceutical industries that graciously prolong our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the mainstream view on the human body. Athletes are exceptional (they get their own label, after all), a healthy lifestyle requires a specifying adjective, &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;isn&#39;t even that healthy&lt;/a&gt;, and sickness is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with the view of the Ancestral Health communities. &lt;strong&gt;We believe that a human being, in its pristine state, is a force to be reckoned with, a marvel of biological engineering, ecological integrity, and spiritual subtlety.&lt;/strong&gt; We heal ourselves, not via magic or superfoods, but because healing is what a healthy body does, and we&#39;ve done everything in our power to remove the obstacles to being normal, which is to say, ridiculously, vibrantly, off-the-wall healthy. Fitness is not even a sufficient term to encompass &lt;a title=&#34;A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;what we meant&lt;/a&gt; by movement/&lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Play&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-play/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;/physically expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those in the Ancestral Health communities--Paleo, &lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MovNat&lt;/a&gt;, Primal, Weston A. Price, barefoot runners--there is a belief in the inherent durability and resilience of the human being. Not only can it move and survive without reliance on extensive protection, but it can actually thrive without such crutches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t speak for everyone; there is a fair amount of division, &lt;a title=&#34;Why I Left Paleo Behind, and Why Iâ€™m Returning&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-i-left-paleo-behind-and-why-im-returning/&#34;&gt;which led me to wander alone for a while&lt;/a&gt;. But it is safe to say there are many who see these ideas as a path to something greater than a simple advantage in the rat-race.</description>
