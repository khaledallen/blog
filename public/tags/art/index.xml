      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I took the Landmark Forum. For those of you who don&#39;t know, Landmark is a personal development coaching workshop that has a reputation for being confrontational. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their coaching method, but I certainly did learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that forms the core of the Landmark approach to life is that life is meaningless, and that this fact is itself meaningless (which is kind of a clever solution to the problem, though it becomes contradictory considering the intention behind making the statement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve been on Warrior Spirit for a while, you know that I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working on the idea that life has no inherent meaning. The conclusion I came to, and that which Landmark offered, is that we create the meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is a simplistic answer that fails to capture the true nature of being, a creative, artistic act.</description>

      <description>One of the greatest literary and artistic accomplishments of Western civilization is an illuminated Bible created in medieval Ireland called The Book of Kells. It contains some of the most intricate illustration anywhere, despite the fact that it was created at a time when having your town pillaged by Vikings was a very real threat and Adobe Illustrator was not yet invented.
What fascinates me about The Book isn&#39;t the beautiful illumination.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I used to do a lot of website design, not because I enjoy writing code, but because I like creative design. For me, there is a lot of pleasure to be had in discerning the best layouts for a page, the colors used to emphasize certain areas and ideas, the interplay of pictures and content in bringing your page to life. I was fairly well-versed in coding techniques as well, and was self-taught in HTML, CSS, and even a little JavaScript. I actually would get pretty involved in the technical side of things just to make a particular button or layout work the way I wanted it to in a clean, efficient manner. But set me down to write a piece of code with the express purpose of calculating and out putting some value and Iâ€™ll just fall asleep. For me, the allure is in the artistic possibility, the connection between the technical and the aesthetic. I find it fascinating how manipulating the very dry and cold elements of HTML and CSS code can produce a work of art. The process is very different than that of working with a brush, in which your actions translate directly to the art being produced. In web design, you are a step removed from your creation.</description>
