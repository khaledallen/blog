      <title>The Question that Will Set You Free</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;True freedom isn&#39;t doing whatever we feel like. It&#39;s being able to do what we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between doing what we want and doing what we feel like. The former takes discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is stressful. Besides all of the frustrations of making ends meet and getting work done, there never seems to be enough time to do everything you should be doing. Besides work, you&#39;ve got your health, exercise, self-improvement, relationships, education, volunteering, cooking, playing...the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, it can get overwhelming, and it&#39;s so much easier to just turn on the autopilot and let things drag you along without thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever find yourself doing any of the following?</description>

      <title>Six Practical Tips to be More Present and Engaged</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The greatest gift you can give someone is your attention&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything else follows from that. Being present is the key to developing an irresistible presence, but staying totally engaged is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shortcut--you have to build that mental muscle through directed practice and commit to using it--but there are some things you can do to make it a little easier.</description>

      <title>The Magical Power of Attention, Your Most Valuable Asset</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/the-magical-power-of-attention-your-most-valuable-asset/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us don&#39;t realize how powerful and valuable our attention is. As a result, we let it leak away and rarely bother to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so powerful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you put your attention on grows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferriss made this point in The 4-Hour Body when he showed that simply tracking your weight daily, without even attempting to make changes, led to consistent weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not necessarily saying there is some magical energy created by humans concentrating on specific things. It probably has to do with small micro-behaviors that start to accumulate when we have something in the forefront of our mind. Maybe constantly thinking about your weight leads your brain to subtly adjust weight-loss metabolic processes or change your appetite in small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe humans are magical.</description>

      <title>If You Don&#39;t Show Up, Life Won&#39;t Either</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/if-you-dont-show-up-life-wont-either/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Work is love made visible. - Khalil Gibran&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have run into two conflicting theories on how success works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get lucky. Opportunities come along or they don&#39;t. You have to be in the right place at the right time or you just won&#39;t get very far. Some people have it, and some people don&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success is entirely dependent on your willingness to put in hard work and dedicate yourself to accomplishing what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lean on the first explanation usually don&#39;t see themselves as very abundant or successful. They feel a lot of frustration around their lives and their dreams, and so they claim that it&#39;s all luck to shirk responsibility for what they see as failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who has done really well, but he gives off a constant anxiety about losing it all. He uses the &#34;I got lucky&#34; argument in a way that absolves him of responsibility for his success, but my guess is he also doesn&#39;t want to think it would be his fault if things don&#39;t turn out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other option is a more empowering viewpoint, but it is also often used to offer excuses. For example, insisting your success is based purely on your hard work might give you permission to ignore others&#39; needs and the realities of the world (market demands, consumer interests, quality of your services, importance of outside help and connections, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, of course there&#39;s a balance.</description>

      <title>Distraction and Fascination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fascinated.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2981&#34; alt=&#34;fascinated&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fascinated.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;387&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature presents the young with something so much greater than they are; it offers an environment where they can easily contemplate infinity and eternity. - Richard Louv, &lt;em&gt;Last Child in the Woods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two children. Both are staring wide-eyed at something, utterly entranced, mouths slightly open. Now back up from each kid and add some context: the first is staring at a TV set, and the second is staring at &lt;a title=&#34;5 Stories of A Little Boy in Nature&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/5-stories-of-a-little-boy-in-nature/&#34;&gt;a spider weaving its web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between nature observation and watching TV?&lt;/strong&gt; Both involve sitting motionless for long periods of time, observing something else, without much interaction on your part beyond the sensory, and letting your mind get carried off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But one is distracting while one is fascinating, and I think that is an important distinction to make.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;em&gt;Last Child in the Woods, &lt;/em&gt;Richard Louv introduced me to the concept of fascination as that thing a natural setting does to children who have the free time and access to explore it. Fascination is what happens when children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build tree houses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;play in the mud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;climb trees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make crowns out of daisies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or just lie in the grass and watch the clouds blow by</description>
