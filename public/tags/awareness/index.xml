      <description>“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.”- Joseph Campbell
 We spend so much time worrying about the future or reliving the past that we rarely if ever experience the present.</description>

      <title>The Art of Productivity</title>

      <description>“It&#39;s not so much how busy you are, but why you are busy. The bee is praised. The mosquito is swatted.” - Mary O&#39;Connor
 There is no real connection between work done and productivity. Some of the most productive things people do, which bring the most joy, money, insight, efficiency, or whatever, take very little time and effort.
And some of the most useless things take all day to do.</description>

      <title>Two Ways to Play the Game of Life</title>

      <description>&#34;Now we&#39;re going to do front flips from high up.&#34; My coach pointed at three platforms and the crash mat below them. &#34;You can do either the 2 foot, the 4 foot, or the 6 foot, whichever you&#39;re comfortable with.&#34;
We all went for the 4 foot platform. It wasn&#39;t so high and scary as the 6 foot, but it was bigger than the 2 foot so we felt like we were pushing ourselves a bit.</description>

      <title>A World Unto Yourself: The Ecological Nature of Health</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/86898565_563dab2319.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2828&#34; alt=&#34;Earth Full South Pacific&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/86898565_563dab2319.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;456&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know thyself. - Plato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body is a wonderfully complex organism. It puts even the most refined watches to shame in terms of the technical precision that enables it to run, and the ingeniousness with which the human (or any other) body is put together continues to astound doctors, philosophers, psychologists, biologists, theologians, and anyone else who witnesses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite this deep complexity, &lt;strong&gt;we often treat our bodies like simple machines&lt;/strong&gt;. We believe that we can change one thing without accounting for anything else. This comes across in the many fitness fads of bulking up vs. cutting vs. toning, as if our bodies were cars that could be tweaked and fine-tuned. All you need to do is lift heavier, or follow this one routine, or eat this one superfood, or take cold showers.</description>

      <title>Be Like a River: Live with Intention</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/be-like-a-river-live-with-intention/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7628864666_fb943c9fcf.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2329&#34; title=&#34;River&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7628864666_fb943c9fcf-300x224.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A river always flows to the ocean. You can divert it, but it will always find a way to continue its journey downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we were like rivers, and moving towards our goals in life was natural and inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third part of Warrior Spirit is Intention: living with directed focus towards a vision of how you want your life, your self, or your world to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-meaning-of-integrity-the-complete-human/&#34;&gt;Integrity &lt;/a&gt;gives us the purpose. We have values and integrity ensures that those values actually matter to us and define who we are. Integrity allows us to live in accordance with our values, and to honestly care about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/&#34;&gt;Awareness &lt;/a&gt;lets us see how our values play out in the world. It lets us understand the impact of our actions and our life. It is compassion for the world. Awareness is accepting what consequences we create, not hiding from the implications of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intention is the essential third point of the triangle that gives it direction. Intention is what allows us to take action on our values and to do something with what our awareness reveals. It is turning belief into action. It is turning dreams into reality.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2259908021_e2ac9dd376.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2068&#34; title=&#34;Three Leaves&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2259908021_e2ac9dd376-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the most frustrating things about this blog is that I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m writing about. It&#39;s my view on life, but it&#39;s been a real pain figuring out what the overarching theme on my life is. I mean, how do you tie together my interest in &lt;a title=&#34;Empty Your Cup: Accepting Ignorance to Learn&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empty-your-cup-accepting-ignorance-to-learn/&#34;&gt;Buddhist spirituality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;A New Understanding of Fitness and the Human Body&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-new-understanding-of-fitness-and-the-human-body/&#34;&gt;evolutionary fitness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Returning to the Dojo: The Importance of Martial Arts&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/returning-to-the-dojo-the-importance-of-martial-arts/&#34;&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Book Review: The Omnivore’s Dilemma&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-onivores-dilemma/&#34;&gt;local food&lt;/a&gt;, environmentalism, &lt;a title=&#34;The Value of Failure&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-value-of-failure/&#34;&gt;positive psychology&lt;/a&gt;, and holistic personal health and growth? To me, all of those things are one and the same, but Google keyword searches don&#39;t generally group them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then I realized that this blog isn&#39;t really about &lt;em&gt;those &lt;/em&gt;things. It is about the approach to living that &lt;em&gt;led&lt;/em&gt; me to those things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the keywords of my life? What about my approach to life led me to adopt evolutionary fitness instead of Fatbusters 2.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; I Prefer the Term...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since reading &lt;em&gt;Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, I&#39;ve spent some time thinking about the words I want to describe me and my lifestyle. I have already written a lot about Integrity, and I know that is a central part of who I want to be and what I believe characterizes the Warrior Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all good things come in threes, I needed two more words. Naturally, I looked to the most annoying things about me.</description>

      <title>Acknowledging My Spiritual Debts</title>

      <description>[caption id=&#34;attachment_427&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;180&#34; caption=&#34;Martin Prechtel&#34;][/caption]
An old friend sent me a link to a really profound article yesterday. The article is an interview with a Pueblo-turned-Mayan-shaman, Martin Prechtel. In the interview Prechtel discusses his relationship with the spiritual world of indigenous cultures that have a respect for, and connection to, the land and environment around them. He also draws some really ominous connections between the utter lack - some would say, outright denial - of spirituality in Western civilization and the cultural malaise we experience in the form of endemic depression, poverty, loneliness, and even physical ailment.</description>
