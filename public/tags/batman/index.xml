      <description>I talk a lot about Batman as an inspiration for training and following ideals, so just for fun, I thought I&#39;d write a post on how exactly the Path of the Warrior can be discerned from his life. To make things more interesting, I will be comparing him to another popular superhero: Spiderman. I picked these two because a) they are very nearly opposites without one being a villain, and b) there were recently made several movies about each.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/khaledbatman.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-339&#34; title=&#34;khaledbatman&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/khaledbatman.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People ask me why I train so hard. The answer is simple. I&#39;m training to be Batman... (as Superman was technically an alien, it would be a bit ridiculous for me to train to be him, since there&#39;s no way I could ever achieve that level of strength and fitness as an Earthling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My CrossFit coaches have offered to pay my registration fee for the New England CrossFit Sectionals in March. While those who know me can attest to the fact that I didn&#39;t really need much motivation to train hard in the past, going to the Sectionals has given me a new kind of motivation and intensity to train. Knowing that I am going to be competing against some of the fittest people in New England, many of them bigger and stronger than me, has gotten me to really kick my training into high gear.</description>
