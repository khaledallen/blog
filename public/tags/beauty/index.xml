&lt;p&gt;Women do not have it easy in our society. For example, they get &lt;a title=&#34;Miss Representation&#34; href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=2349117563337&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;objectified&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Why a Woman Can Never Win Against a Man&#34; href=&#34;http://www.care2.com/causes/why-a-woman-can-never-win-against-a-man.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;have their world records revoked&lt;/a&gt;, and are underrepresented in American government. Nobody thinks these things are okay (and if you do, you suck). Women also have to put up with an unrealistic and extremely narrow definition of beauty. Yet a lot of men see no reason to work to change they way they see women or deal with them. Would you boycott almost every show on TV? Would you date a girl you respected, even if she wasn’t stereotypically sexual? Would you turn down the svelte, leggy blonde for the intelligent, athletic brunette?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, for many men, the answer is no, even if they would prefer to meet the latter lady. The result is that a lot of women feel that they aren’t desirable unless they look a particular way. The problem doesn’t just affect women, however.</description>
