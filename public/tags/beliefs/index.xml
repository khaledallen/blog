      <description>I came across a study recently looking at the relationship between stress and health. The study uncovered a relationship between high levels of stress and premature death, but only when those suffering the high stress also believed that stress was bad for them.
What I thought interesting is that the group that didn&#39;t believe stress was negative still experienced the same amount of stress. They just didn&#39;t die from it.</description>
