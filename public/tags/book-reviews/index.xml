Michael Ellsberg&#39;s book is just such a one. It snares you with its controversial premise: &lt;strong&gt;higher education fails to provide the skills necessary to be successful in the real world&lt;/strong&gt;. It keeps you reading by explaining what skills you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;need and how to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has every wondered why, with their expensive degree and pristine grades, they are stuck working meaningless jobs that make no use of their skills, this book provides both the answer and the solution to bettering their chances to make it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Education of Millionaires&#34; href=&#34;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-of-millionaires-michael-ellsberg/1103297348?ean=9781591844204&amp;amp;itm=1&amp;amp;usri=the+education+of+millionaires&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Education of Millionaires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basically presents a course list for success in business and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a strong advocate of &lt;a title=&#34;The Principles of &#39;Good&#39; Business&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p15g8X-tF&#34;&gt;business with integrity&lt;/a&gt; and success as a means to make a positive difference in the world.</description>

      <title>E-book Review: A Simple Guide to Eating Well</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/simpleguide.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1209&#34; title=&#34;simpleguide&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/simpleguide-237x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;237&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a review of an e-book by a fellow blogger that I&#39;ve followed for years. His blog, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://zentofitness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zen to Fitness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; is inspired by the idea that health and vitality should not be a struggle. I am not an affiliate marketer for his book; this review is simply me sharing insights on an interesting book I read by a blogger who has inspired my own fitness pursuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a great deal of time learning about and exploring many different kinds of diets, I’ve come across a lot of overly complicated explanations of how to eat healthy. Everyone seems to think their way is best, but I’ve found that the basic principles of diets that actually work are always the same: eat meals balanced in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, made from fresh, high quality ingredients. Avoid too much sugar, and enjoy your food, eating when you’re hungry until you’re full. Whether it’s Paleo, Primal, Zone, Locavore, Vegtarian, Vegan, or Traditional, these principles always seem to hold. Of course, exponents of each diet focus on what makes them different, and this just leads to confusion. Vegans will tell you that eating meat leads to bodily decay, while the Paleo crowd will tell you that not eating meat leads to decrepitude.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hide not your talents. They for use were made. What is a sundial in the shade?&#34; &lt;em&gt;- Benjamin Franklin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really know what you are good at? Or are you, like most people, more aware of your failings than your strengths? And how much of your time is spent doing things you are really good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most people (70% according to the Gallup organization) do not get to work at something they are good at. Most of their time is spent doing a job or duty which they find frustrating, difficult, or unintuitive. This costs them their sense of self-esteem, job satisfaction, and productivity, making them resent their work and perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tom Rath, author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159562015X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=warrspir-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159562015X&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=warrspir-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=159562015X&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
, this is a situation that can be remedied to the benefit of organization and individuals.</description>
