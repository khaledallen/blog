      <description>There isn&#39;t a blog post for today because coping with the displacement caused by the Boulder floods has prevented me from finding the time to write. I did my best with the posts in the last week, but it finally caught up with me.
I do want to express how grateful I am to have such amazing friends, people who were willing to take us in on a moment&#39;s notice. A friend picked us up around 11pm in his car during the height of the flood on Wednesday night, after we&#39;d been evacuated.</description>
