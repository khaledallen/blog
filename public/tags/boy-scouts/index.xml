&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked who the people in the canoe on the top banner are. It&#39;s no surprise that one of them is me. The other person is a guy who has been like a brother to me since fifth grade, when I stumbled awkwardly on to the shores of this country, a naive Arab with no clue how to handle this overwhelming America, as it were. He took me under his wing, and attempted (in vain) to teach me the ways of the American schoolboy. Since then, we&#39;ve been through almost everything together: we&#39;ve gotten to the point of mutual hatred, we&#39;ve come to appreciate the man-hug, we got our Eagle Scout badges at the same time and held a joint ceremony, we&#39;ve SCUBA dived together, and undertaken the most sacred of modern manly bonding rituals: Playing through Halo&#39;s Co-op Campaign on Legendary difficulty. He was my inspiration to get better at video games, and sports, and we&#39;ve been up until 3 AM countless times arguing the finer points of moral philosophy.</description>

      <title>Pigeonholing Myself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/pigeon.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-507&#34; title=&#34;pigeon&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pigeon.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In high school, we have so many dreams and activities. In order to be competitive for college, we fill our transcripts with a crazy variety of activities: math club, Boy Scouts, flying lessons, karate, cross country, guitar, piano lessons. This is in addition to our classes, which tend to cover a wide range of subjects: precalc, biology, English, painting. Then in college, we start off with a fairly broad range of topics to study, and as we move towards our major, the subjects narrow down to one or two: psychology and international studies of the Middle East. Then, after college, we get a job and are expected to become experts in one single field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to consider myself a renaissance man, with interests in a wide range of activities, but I&#39;m not so sure anymore. After all, I spend so much of my time studying fitness and in training. My conversations with people tend to gravitate towards talk about health, fitness, and nutrition. Last night while bartending,  a guy at the bar wanted to watch the NFL draft, and I had no clue how to have a conversation with him. I never really followed or understood football, but it made be wonder if I&#39;m either out of touch with society or simply too narrow in my interests.</description>
