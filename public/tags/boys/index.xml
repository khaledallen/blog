&lt;p&gt;“It is the character of a brave and resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his post” &lt;em&gt;- Marcus Tullius Cicero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old school no longer plays dodgeball. It is against the rules. The children are urged to forget the game. In fact, we no longer play any games with a score, for fear of engendering competition. The fear is that kids will lord it over one another, put down the losers and gloat in their victory. They will brag and tease and ostracize their peers, or will feel hurt and put down. Some parents and administrators probably worry that kids who lose at dodgeball are more likely to do something violent to vent their frustration. I think this prevents kids from developing strong character.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked who the people in the canoe on the top banner are. It&#39;s no surprise that one of them is me. The other person is a guy who has been like a brother to me since fifth grade, when I stumbled awkwardly on to the shores of this country, a naive Arab with no clue how to handle this overwhelming America, as it were. He took me under his wing, and attempted (in vain) to teach me the ways of the American schoolboy. Since then, we&#39;ve been through almost everything together: we&#39;ve gotten to the point of mutual hatred, we&#39;ve come to appreciate the man-hug, we got our Eagle Scout badges at the same time and held a joint ceremony, we&#39;ve SCUBA dived together, and undertaken the most sacred of modern manly bonding rituals: Playing through Halo&#39;s Co-op Campaign on Legendary difficulty. He was my inspiration to get better at video games, and sports, and we&#39;ve been up until 3 AM countless times arguing the finer points of moral philosophy.</description>
