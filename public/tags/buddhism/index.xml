      <title>Insecurity, the Root of All Evil</title>

      <description>A short post, tracing the development of an idea.
I&#39;ve been struggling a lot with patience lately. Patience for myself and for others.
I&#39;m normally a really patient person, so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I&#39;ve been feeling so impatient lately. If I look at the way things have been going, I&#39;d have to say that the biggest change is a constant sense of insecurity regarding my financial life.</description>

      <title>The Smiling Swordsman</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474-e1371668311238.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3029&#34; alt=&#34;rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rurouni-kenshin-anime-184474-e1371668311238.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We once fought together for an ideal with our swords. It wasn&#39;t for power or for glory, but to create a peaceful world where people could live without fear. And, if you should forget about that, then what did we fight the revolution for? &lt;em&gt;- Himura Kenshin, &lt;/em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin Anime Series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend recently introduced me to an anime series called Rurouni Kenshin, about a young man name Himura Kenshin who was an assassin during the Meiji Restoration, a massive revolution in 19th century Japan. The Meiji Restoration&#39;s greatest effect was the transference of political power from the militaristic, samurai-controlled Tokagawa Shogunate, which had ruled for 200 years, back to the emperor and his ministers. It also marked the start of modernization, both technologically and socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I want to take a moment to express how lucky and grateful I am to have a girlfriend who insists I watch anime series).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenshin was renown as the greatest assassin during the revolution, but the show is actually about him trying to renounce his bloody past and help Japan solidify its new peace. In one episode, his friend points out that Kenshin, of all people, feels the most anger towards the new government because he fought so hard to bring it into existence, only to find it just as exploitative and full of corruption. However, unlike many other characters in the series, Kenshin doesn&#39;t see this as justification for continued strife and fighting. Even with the corruption of the new government, he would rather do what he can to ease the lives of everyday people than support another bloody revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He is able to look past his personal feelings and the short-sighted agendas of those he deals with to see the effects on the people of Japan. There is sometimes an air of resignation about him--he must accept the lesser of two evils to preserve peace--but he also carries a lot of hope and faith in the innate goodness of humanity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenshin&#39;s character is very interesting for a number of reasons, but the thing that inspires me the most is how he &lt;strong&gt;tries to enjoy the little moments of every day&lt;/strong&gt;. He is usually seen smiling, playing with children, making silly jokes, and generally enjoying life. When a villain shows up with the intention of taking advantage of the weak or causing mayhem, Kenshin puts them in their place very quickly, but for the most part, he tries to appreciate his new life and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenshin epitomizes the Warrior Spirit, combining a deep and ruthless concern for the well-being of others with a determination to experience life as joyful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the series, there are many characters who respond to the results of revolution much differently, stubbornly fixating on something that upsets them. They may have good intentions, but more often than not, they end up as villains. &lt;strong&gt;Their anger and frustration drive them to acts of violence that hurt others or threaten a return to a state of war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We Create a World to be Bitter In&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes worry about crossing that line. I see a lot to be upset about in the world.</description>

      <title>A Seon Templestay in Korea</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/a-seon-templestay-in-korea/</link>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we get too caught up in the busyness of the world, we lose connection with one another - and ourselves. - Jack Kornfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2851&#34; align=&#34;aligncenter&#34; width=&#34;717&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_9400-Version-2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-2851 &#34; alt=&#34;Photo credit: Anna &amp;quot;Rocketpack&amp;quot; Pusack&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSC_9400-Version-2-1024x685.jpg&#34; width=&#34;717&#34; height=&#34;479&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Photo credit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rocketpackphoto.com&#34;&gt;Anna &#34;Rocketpack&#34; Pusack&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke abruptly in a pitch dark cell, wrapped in pre-dawn silence. Suddenly, the distant wooden bell that had woken me rang out again, accompanied by the ghostly chanting of a Korean Seon (Zen) monk whose duty it was to rouse fellow monks, visiting foreigners, and stubborn Korean teenagers. The sounds faded quickly, swallowed by the forests and mountains around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 4:00am. The world gave no indication that morning was in the schedule. I had come here exactly for the discipline of this simple temple life, but even I found it difficult to rouse myself this early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bell and the chanting monk came closer, moving out of the mystical realm into the waking world. It was time to get up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I folded my blankets, pulled on my jacket, slid out the heavy wooden door of my sleeping cell, and started up the mountain to join the others in a session of Buddhist chanting and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping into a small, close shrine, I took my place at a meditation cushion. My girlfriend and I had been taught the day before how to do the introductory bows, and we went through them now, knees and backs aching. Soon, everyone had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A monk rang a clapper and all was silent. Then, as abrupt and distinct as the lone wooden bell, chanting rang out and engulfed the room. We were carried away in its driving, insistent rhythm that thrummed like a force of nature through our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Buddha awoke within us like a lotus, coaxed from sleep by the relentless, comforting chants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began my templestay at Golgulsa Temple in Gyeong-ju, South Korea.</description>

      <title>Empower Yourself Through Humility</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/empower-yourself-through-humility/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/empower-yourself-through-humility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/16112_700950337914_589075632_n-e1360535516995.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2802&#34; alt=&#34;Bowing Before the Buddha&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/16112_700950337914_589075632_n-e1360535516995.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;545&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility reminds us that we are human. It reminds us not to overestimate our abilities, not to get sloppy and lazy, to always be present and give our best effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility reminds us that the big tasks, the ones that matter, really are difficult, even for such amazing warriors as ourselves. &lt;strong&gt;Remembering this, we will remain focused, taking the task seriously and bringing to it the attention it deserves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility says, &#34;I could mess this up, so I will make sure I don&#39;t.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the fool forgoes humility for hubris. If he is talented, he will get far, but eventually, the task at hand will be bigger than he can handle casually. Eventually, it will require an acceptance of the need for help, either from other people or deeper wells of energy and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve adopted the habit of bowing upon waking and just before bed. Bowing is an interesting form of devotion because it is an expression of humility. You are honoring whatever you bow to by being humble before it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that suggests an acknowledgement of how much we rely on certain things and how important mindfulness is. I recite certain gratitudes when I bow. For example, I give thanks for the opportunity to rest and recover at night, and then I bow. This expresses the acknowledgement that I don&#39;t necessarily have the right to peaceful rest -- many people don&#39;t get it. I am thankful for it, but also humbled by it, since I depend on it to function.</description>

      <title>You&#39;re Not the One Who Will Achieve Your Dreams</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/youre-not-the-one-who-will-achieve-your-dreams/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“The recipe for perpetual ignorance is: Be satisfied with your opinions and content with your knowledge.” -Elbert Hubbard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know what we are, but know now what we may be.” - William Shakespeare&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6527715119_b568570ab2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2499&#34; title=&#34;The Illusion of the Self&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/6527715119_b568570ab2-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest obstacles to accomplishing our greatest dreams and goals is the fear of growth. We are unwilling to change, even in a positive way, because growth is painful. Even when we get stronger as a result, we tend to shy away from the necessary discomfort that comes with the process of improving ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After all, growth only comes as the result of learning to deal with challenges that are slightly beyond us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is that,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in order to accomplish our goals, we must grow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we didn&#39;t need to grow, we would already be doing what we dream about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on our particular dream, the kind of change and growth we need will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to get stronger, faster, healthier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to make more connections and meet more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to gain deeper insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to learn new ideas and master new theories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to see the world in a slightly different way that empowers us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to play a bigger game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need to be comfortable with the things that scare us at the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, that last one covers all the others, and it is significant because it is integral to our sense of who we are. &lt;strong&gt;Our fears create our limiting image of ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2405&#34; title=&#34;A Helping Hand&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o-e1347370123178-300x223.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some people choose not to donate their services because they believe that it somehow devalues them by &#34;giving them away.&#34; In truth, there is nothing that demonstrates the value of your skills more than putting them to good use for a cause you believe in. - Scott Allen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in good shape can be dangerous. It can be very easy to slip into feelings of superiority: “I’m stronger than others. I take better care of myself. I look sexier than most people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is the worst thing in the world, but when I caught myself sneaking too many glances in the mirror and comparing myself to others at my gym, I started to feel that perhaps my &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34;&gt;priorities&lt;/a&gt; were out of line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, when I was particularly annoyed with my pride, I remembered the story of the Siddhartha Guatama. Siddhartha was a prince who grew up sheltered from suffering but who one day witnessed sickness and death and realized that all his princely luxury, his youth, and his health would fall away. He began to question whether all that he had would truly spare him from suffering or make the world a better place. He gave it all away to seek spiritual enlightenment, eventually achieving &lt;em&gt;nirvana&lt;/em&gt; as the historical Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I realized that, proud as I am of my strong, attractive body, it will one day succumb to death&lt;/strong&gt;. At best, I would remain strong and vital until my twilight years, free of chronic disease, then die suddenly and peacefully. As a believer in the &lt;a title=&#34;The Optimism of Ancestral Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-optimism-of-ancestral-health/&#34;&gt;inherent integrity&lt;/a&gt; of the human body, I see this as a distinct possibility. At worst, I’ll succumb to the diseases of aging, watch my strength wither away, and suffer a long, slow decline. &lt;strong&gt;No matter what, I end up being totally useless and utterly repulsive: dead and rotting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of my sense of self-worth was attached to something as impermanent as my health or appearance, my pride was clearly ill-founded. &lt;strong&gt;These things will disappear, so my self-worth and happiness will suffer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body, strength, youth, and vitality I worked so hard to attain will inevitably one day fall away from me. In full acceptance of that truth, I had to find a compelling reason to take care of my health regardless.</description>

      <title>Be Like a River: Live with Intention</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/be-like-a-river-live-with-intention/</link>

      <guid>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/be-like-a-river-live-with-intention/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7628864666_fb943c9fcf.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2329&#34; title=&#34;River&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7628864666_fb943c9fcf-300x224.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A river always flows to the ocean. You can divert it, but it will always find a way to continue its journey downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only we were like rivers, and moving towards our goals in life was natural and inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third part of Warrior Spirit is Intention: living with directed focus towards a vision of how you want your life, your self, or your world to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Meaning of Integrity: The Complete Human&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-meaning-of-integrity-the-complete-human/&#34;&gt;Integrity &lt;/a&gt;gives us the purpose. We have values and integrity ensures that those values actually matter to us and define who we are. Integrity allows us to live in accordance with our values, and to honestly care about the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The 3 Things You Need for a Complete Life (my mother agrees)&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/3-things-complete-life/&#34;&gt;Awareness &lt;/a&gt;lets us see how our values play out in the world. It lets us understand the impact of our actions and our life. It is compassion for the world. Awareness is accepting what consequences we create, not hiding from the implications of our actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intention is the essential third point of the triangle that gives it direction. Intention is what allows us to take action on our values and to do something with what our awareness reveals. It is turning belief into action. It is turning dreams into reality.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;We make sacred pact. I promise teach karate to you, you promise learn. I say, you do, no questions.&#34; -Mr. Miyagi, Karate Kid (1984)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad has been baking a lot of bread recently, experimenting with different ingredients and developing his own unique style of bread. When I read his cookbook, I found out why. Instead of simply giving him a bread recipe, the author of his book explains what each step is intended to accomplish: the various factors that determine how much flour to use, how long to let the bread rise, why you let the bread rise, and what occurs in the dough during baking. It borders on chemistry, but the result is that my dad has a much better grasp of why each step must be taken, and can make adjustments to get his desired effect. If he wants to get a crispier crust, he knows what to change and how to compensate to avoid ruining his loaves.</description>

      <description>A strange thing happened recently. My life went from being hectic, disorganized, and frustrating to suddenly clear and productive. This happened without any warning, and without any real discernible change in my circumstances. In the same way that you feel a lot lighter and calmer when you realize you&#39;ve been restricting your breathing and start taking deep breaths, something in my mindset that was cramped and tight simply relaxed.
This has had a number of interesting effects:</description>
