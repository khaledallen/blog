&lt;p&gt;“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.” - Carl G. Jung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an excerpt out of a book by Carl Jung last night, and was interested to find a concept that parallels one of the ideas in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Hero with a Thousand Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Namely, that every individual must find and undergo their own path to individual self-actualization, rather than being able to follow some generalized path. This probably explains why we can spend so much time reading how-to&#39;s and inspirational blogs and never actually get around to doing something; we are reading about someone else&#39;s hero journey, and trying to take it as the direction for our own. Jung&#39;s point was that there is no universal psychological concept that can be applied to every person&#39;s situation and specific problem, despite the modern trend to try to put everyone under a general diagnosis.</description>
