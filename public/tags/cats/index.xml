One of the problems with being my age is that I forget how inexperienced I am and how much I have to learn about myself and life in general. I sometimes trick myself into thinking I can do anything and everything. I am wrong, but I still persist, sometimes to my detriment and that of others around me. Nowhere is that truth driven home more forcefully than in relationships and the delicate dance that is loving another person.</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve been helping out at the CT Humane Society for a few months now, and have spent a lot of time with really adorable, heartbreakingly cute kitties and puppies that want nothing more than to play and be loved. Yeah, it&#39;s rough work, but someone&#39;s got to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve learned a lot of important things from these animals, both from their suffering and the little joys they manage to find in life at the shelter. Here are some examples:</description>

&lt;p&gt;“I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.” -Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been volunteering as a cat cuddler (yes that is as awesome as it sounds) and a dog walker at the local humane society. My responsibilities involve socializing the abandoned animals. Many people don&#39;t realize how hard it is for a dog or cat to be left behind or given away. The animal feels betrayed and can respond by becoming aggressive or exceedingly timid. It is so sad to see little puppies and kittens hiding scared, though they tend to rebound quickly and make new friends. The hardest thing is seeing an older animal too timid to come out of its cage.</description>
