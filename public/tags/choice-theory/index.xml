&lt;p&gt;“Maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you&#39;ve had, and what you&#39;ve learned from them, and less to do with how many birthdays you&#39;ve celebrated.” - Anon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often tell me that I am exceptionally mature for my age. Ignoring the truthfulness of this statement, I&#39;ve always been curious what that means exactly. Generally, the implication is that adults are more mature than children, but even as a child, I knew several adults more emotionally unstable than I and who were far worse at taking care of themselves. That said, I also know a few youngsters who make me feel positively infantile. So how is it possible for a younger person to have more maturity than an older person?</description>
