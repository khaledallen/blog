&lt;p&gt;All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sand pile at school. &lt;em&gt;- Robert Fulghum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children give you a lot of perspective on life. They are impossible to keep in order, except when you do seemingly trivial and silly things. They seem very rude and uncouth most of the time, but the best way to get them to do what you want is simply to ask nicely. They remind you what&#39;s important in life, and the importance of friends, food, and enough rest. They also teach you how to appreciate the little things in life, like the wonder of floating on a surfboard in the sun (something I find endlessly tedious) and how stupid things can be really, legitimately funny.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is the character of a brave and resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his post” &lt;em&gt;- Marcus Tullius Cicero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old school no longer plays dodgeball. It is against the rules. The children are urged to forget the game. In fact, we no longer play any games with a score, for fear of engendering competition. The fear is that kids will lord it over one another, put down the losers and gloat in their victory. They will brag and tease and ostracize their peers, or will feel hurt and put down. Some parents and administrators probably worry that kids who lose at dodgeball are more likely to do something violent to vent their frustration. I think this prevents kids from developing strong character.</description>
