      <description>Last month, I spent a day enjoying a river park that runs past my home in Korea. While the exercise itself was freeing, what really struck me was how simply being playful and exercising like this seemed to connect with other people, even those I couldn&#39;t communicate with. The natural, playful movement intrigued people, brought them joy, even inspired some of them to try it themselves. It was as if seeing an &#39;adult&#39; playing let them believe it was okay for them to engage with their own bodies in ways they normally left to their kids.</description>
