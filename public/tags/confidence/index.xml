      <description>As long as you truly respect the other person, you can say whatever you want without hurting them. - A friend
 It&#39;s not a compliment, being called a nice guy. &#34;Nice guys finish last&#34; means that being nice is giving up ambition and assertiveness.
Or maybe you&#39;ve heard, &#34;No more Mr. Nice Guy,&#34; meaning, &#34;I&#39;m done holding back my true abilities,&#34; or, &#34;Now I&#39;m going to say what I mean.</description>

      <title>The Secret of Authentic Confidence</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself.” -Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&#39;s eternal question: Do you gain self-respect when your worth is proven in the world, or do you prove your worth by cultivating honest self-respect? And can you fake it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve noticed a harmful trend in personal development literature, in every field from entrepreneurship to dating, recommending over-the-top confidence, arrogance, and sometimes outright lying. In an attempt to get shy quiet types like me to actually sell ourselves, these gurus assure us that pushy sales tactics are a perfectly legitimate way to interact with people. We need to get over our sqeamishness and man-up, whether it&#39;s bulldozing a client to close a deal or asserting dominance to &#39;pick up&#39; a date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I disagree. I think that kind of arrogance is symptomatic of people who lack real confidence and so have to rely on a facade of bravado.&lt;/strong&gt; There is certainly value in rehearsal, routines, and templates, but these should serve as a framework to human interaction, not the basis of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Built-in BS Detector&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t think anyone can tell the difference? The human brain is really good at making judgement about other people based on subtle body language clues that give away a person&#39;s true character. For example, after watching a 30 second silent clip of a teacher interacting with a student, research subjects were able to predict how well the teacher would do on their evaluation at the end of the semester. Similar results were found with political candidates (2 seconds of exposure) and doctors facing malpractice suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, we&#39;re really good at telling when people are inauthentic. (Whether we give credence to what we detect and actually act on our instinct is a matter of &lt;a title=&#34;Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/&#34;&gt;trusting your intuition&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fake It &#39;til You Make It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&#39;ve also noticed that people tend to assume you have an accurate idea of your own value. That is, if you act like you&#39;re &#34;kind of a big deal,&#34; they&#39;ll treat you that way unless circumstances prove otherwise (they may still challenge or test you to check if you&#39;re bluffing, so don&#39;t actually lie). &lt;strong&gt;If you act like you&#39;re not capable or worthy of respect and responsibility, others will treat you accordingly, even if you&#39;re actual accomplishments suggest otherwise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Ways to Boost Your Courage Right Now!</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/5-ways-to-boost-your-courage-right-now/</link>

      <description>Courage is a valuable commodity. Under various guises--moxie, confidence, spunk, gusto--you can turn a shaky idea into a winning proposition, or go from a wallflower to the life of the party. We crave just the FEELING of courage, even if it&#39;s only temporary and hollow, and have created a societal ritual around &#39;liquid courage&#39; and partying to chase that feeling.
Obviously, it&#39;s better to cultivate a more lasting kind of courage, but sometimes you just need a quick boost.</description>

      <title>Insecurity, the Root of All Evil</title>

      <description>A short post, tracing the development of an idea.
I&#39;ve been struggling a lot with patience lately. Patience for myself and for others.
I&#39;m normally a really patient person, so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I&#39;ve been feeling so impatient lately. If I look at the way things have been going, I&#39;d have to say that the biggest change is a constant sense of insecurity regarding my financial life.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently reading Tom Wolfe&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I am Charlotte Simmons, &lt;/em&gt;a magnificently detailed and richly described look at American college life. One of the main characters, Hoyt, is at the top of the college social ladder, a frat boy. His big claim to fame is the accidental witnessing of the visiting governor of California in a compromising situation, and a subsequent confrontation with the governor&#39;s bodyguard. The bodyguard challenged Hoyt and his friend, but instead of backing down, Hoyt took the question seriously, responding to the bodyguard &#34;what do you two think you&#39;re doing?&#34; with an honest answer. His confidence in his right to be there caught the bodyguard off guard, getting him angry enough to attack the boys, to his ultimate detriment.</description>
