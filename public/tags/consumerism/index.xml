&lt;p&gt;Traffic has been especially bad lately. As I worked my way through New York traffic the other day, I was astounded at how many miles of road there are and that every single one is choked with traffic. There are just so many cars on the road. It is worrying to me knowing all the resources that not only went into producing those cars, but also go into keeping them running every single day. Itâ€™s not that there are a lot of cars. There is an incomprehensible number. As far as the eye can see, nothing but smog-spewing vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this be sustainable?</description>
