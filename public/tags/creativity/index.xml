&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you&#39;ve got to let everything go - purge yourself. If you are unhappy with anything . . . whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you&#39;ll find that when you&#39;re free, your true creativity, your true self comes out.” - Tina Turner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity! The word rings of freedom, personal fulfillment, making a difference. It is how we contribute to the world around us and &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; new realities out of our ideas. Most of us were very creative when we were young. When I was younger, I was immensely creative. I would write short stories daily. I was constantly drawing things on my school papers, and I filled up several sketchbooks. I even wrote poetry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought that my creativity was the result of a messy, hectic life, but my life got a lot messier in college, right about the time my creativity disappeared.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was reading a short piece on creative motivation last  week that asserted that very few of our thoughts are truly our own.  According to the author, most of what we think falls into the category  of ‘monkey-mind,’ which is a term I recognized from studying Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it refers to the thought process that jumps from  one topic to another without ever really getting anywhere. Like a  distracted monkey in a playpen, the mind simply takes up whatever  catches its interest for a moment. It may play with the idea for a  while, but quickly discards it for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with true clarity of thought in which the  mind is focused on a singular aim at the exclusion of all else. By  remaining focused and mostly empty, the clear mind can direct all its  energies to accomplishing some task or plan.</description>

      <title>How I Find Time to Write</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/typewriter.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-516&#34; title=&#34;Old typewriter help&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/typewriter.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I know that lately, I haven&#39;t been posting as regularly as  I used to. I&#39;ve felt the consequences. My readership has declined, and I feel like my writing style has gotten a little stiff from lack of flexing. Writing has always been a hugely important part of my life. Not only is it an artistic means to express myself, it has always been associated with periods of balance in my life; when I&#39;m writing regularly, my mind and spirit are in order, and a lot of other things as well. When I can&#39;t find the time to write, things slowly come apart at the seams. I don&#39;t really know why this is. Perhaps writing is how I parse my jumbled thoughts into discrete, comprehensible units called words and sentences, which I can then manipulate and act on in my life. Without taking the time to do this, my thoughts and ideas just fill to the brim and overflow in a messy jumble of psychic disorder. Writing is a form of meditation, a kind of waking dreaming for me.</description>
