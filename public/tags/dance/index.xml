&lt;p&gt;I used to do a lot of website design, not because I enjoy writing code, but because I like creative design. For me, there is a lot of pleasure to be had in discerning the best layouts for a page, the colors used to emphasize certain areas and ideas, the interplay of pictures and content in bringing your page to life. I was fairly well-versed in coding techniques as well, and was self-taught in HTML, CSS, and even a little JavaScript. I actually would get pretty involved in the technical side of things just to make a particular button or layout work the way I wanted it to in a clean, efficient manner. But set me down to write a piece of code with the express purpose of calculating and out putting some value and Iâ€™ll just fall asleep. For me, the allure is in the artistic possibility, the connection between the technical and the aesthetic. I find it fascinating how manipulating the very dry and cold elements of HTML and CSS code can produce a work of art. The process is very different than that of working with a brush, in which your actions translate directly to the art being produced. In web design, you are a step removed from your creation.</description>
