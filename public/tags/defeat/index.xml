&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I was obsessed with D&amp;amp;D. I spent hours on it, and I once created a very elaborate description of a world born of my imagination. At the time, it was the longest thing I&#39;d ever written, about 40 pages. This was a big deal for an aspiring writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I opened my computer and the document was gone. I was simply left with 40 pages of garbled text symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was defeated and considered just forgetting it had ever existed. It had taken so much work, and I felt that if something that big could be destroyed so easily, what was the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody else in the world would miss it.</description>
