We get to spend the next four years discovering our interests academically, finding our social niche, and figuring out our professional futures so that when we graduate...we still have no idea what we want to do with our lives. The problem is multi-faceted, but hinges on the fact that college is not a reflection of the real world. The subjects are not applied as they would be, the social life is completely unique, and the reward system does not reflect how people find fulfillment outside of college. Furthermore, there is a lot of pressure in college to do what is best for our academic or professional future, and too often the focus is on short term requirements to meet various grant or internship criteria, not personal happiness.</description>
