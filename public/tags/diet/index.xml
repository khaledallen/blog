      <title>Are You Too Stupid to Understand Your Health?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/paleomeal.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3055&#34; alt=&#34;paleomeal&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/paleomeal-300x200.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild lettuce is nearly inedible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How strange that this food, touted as one of the healthiest icons of a simple, wholesome diet, is not a food humans regularly consumed prior to the advent of agriculture. Wild carrots are woody and fibrous; wild avocados had hardly enough meat to be worth eating; bananas were so full of seeds they would be inedible to modern people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently learned all this watching a video entitled, &#34;&lt;a title=&#34;Debunking the Paleo Diet&#34; href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOjVYgYaG8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Debunking the Paleo Myth&lt;/a&gt;&#34; (as usual, I&#39;m way behind the curve). I knew that much of Paleo was based on romantic  but unrealistic notions of Paleolithic cavemen and women living in an edenic utopia chasing mammoth for exercise and eating garden salads, but I had no idea how far off we were.</description>

      <title>Eating Takes Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2035&#34; title=&#34;Slow Food Snail&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg-300x298.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People used to hunt for their food, or risk their lives to find and gather it. When we settled down to farm, we still had to work hard all year to ensure we had enough. Food was needed to live, but we also paid a high price to acquire it. So, when we ate it, we respected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how healthy I eat, I never seem to enjoy the &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt; when all I can think about is the &lt;em&gt;nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. I never realized how important it is to bring some compassion to mealtime in order to truly benefit from eating. This attitude elevates eating from mere consumption for the sake of maintenance, to true Nourishment, that gives us the energy to rise above life’s challenges, instead of simply enduring them.</description>

      <title>The Truth About My Training and Diet</title>

&lt;p&gt;As a CrossFit trainer, I sometimes feel like I&#39;m not allowed to use, much less espouse, alternative forms of physical training or diet. But since I&#39;ve been caught so many times doing very un-CrossFit-like things, and a lot of people ask me what my training program is, or what my diet is, I thought I&#39;d come clean.</description>

      <title>E-book Review: A Simple Guide to Eating Well</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/simpleguide.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1209&#34; title=&#34;simpleguide&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/simpleguide-237x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;237&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a review of an e-book by a fellow blogger that I&#39;ve followed for years. His blog, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://zentofitness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zen to Fitness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; is inspired by the idea that health and vitality should not be a struggle. I am not an affiliate marketer for his book; this review is simply me sharing insights on an interesting book I read by a blogger who has inspired my own fitness pursuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a great deal of time learning about and exploring many different kinds of diets, I’ve come across a lot of overly complicated explanations of how to eat healthy. Everyone seems to think their way is best, but I’ve found that the basic principles of diets that actually work are always the same: eat meals balanced in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, made from fresh, high quality ingredients. Avoid too much sugar, and enjoy your food, eating when you’re hungry until you’re full. Whether it’s Paleo, Primal, Zone, Locavore, Vegtarian, Vegan, or Traditional, these principles always seem to hold. Of course, exponents of each diet focus on what makes them different, and this just leads to confusion. Vegans will tell you that eating meat leads to bodily decay, while the Paleo crowd will tell you that not eating meat leads to decrepitude.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Meat and veggies, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar -&lt;em&gt;The Paleo Diet in a nutshell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my friends know I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/my-paleo-journey/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;follow an approximately Paleo diet&lt;/a&gt;, and a lot of people argue with me as to why it is silly to eat like Paleolithic humans. I thought I would take the time to dispel some myths and misunderstandings about this &#39;diet&#39;, and hopefully win a few converts.</description>
