&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to run barefoot for a long time, since the Vibram FiveFingers came out several years ago. Unfortunately, I’ve also been injuring myself since that time. Undaunted, I’ve kept trying new methods to learn, different ways to ease into it, and different cross-training and recovery techniques. In the end, it was a kind shoestore clerk and an epic story that made the difference. The clerk at the shoe store gave me a barefoot running instructional book (free just for showing interest in a pair of shoes he ordered that I didn’t even have to purchase). The epic story was &lt;em&gt;Born to Run.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“As I have said, the first thing is to be honest with yourself. You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself... Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but humility.” -&lt;em&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for a 5k run today, the first I&#39;ve undertaken in over a year. Despite all the intense anaerobic exercise I do at CrossFit, the fact that I can run a 5:05 mile, and my powerful legs, I found it extremely difficult. So difficult, in fact, that I walked near the end and got a time that was worse than my best high school time. My ankles are sore and I feel more beat up than usual. But really, I&#39;m not that surprised I didn&#39;t do as well as I thought I could. After all, I may be a very well-rounded athlete, but I know that distance running has become a definite area of neglect in my training.</description>
