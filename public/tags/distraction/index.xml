&lt;p&gt;In the last week, I&#39;ve sold my laptop and replaced it with an Apple iPad 2. This leaves me without a regular computer capable of such basic functions as running flash programs, storing more than a few hours of music and video, and playing the most interesting games out there. Instead, I&#39;ve got myself a tiny, super light tablet about 10&#34; large that I can take anywhere. And, even more important, I have no distractions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;_mcePaste&#34;&gt;If while washing dishes, we think only of the cup of tea that awaits us, thus hurrying to get the dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance, then we are not &#34;washing the dishes to wash the dishes.&#34; What&#39;s more, we are not alive during the time we are washing the dishes.... While drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things, barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the future -and we are incapable of actually living one minute of life. - Naht Hahn, &lt;em&gt;Miracle of Mindfulness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern technology is a wonderful thing. It gives us access to more information than we could possibly ever hope to read and understand. It connects us to people all over the world and lets us share ideas and conversations with them on a whim. It puts the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. As a college student, I was infinitely grateful for the fact that I could do almost all my research and class readings online without having to spend hours in the bookstacks looking for texts. At the click of a button, I could bring to my attention the latest psychological research and in the same breath skim an article on current events.&lt;/p&gt;
