&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1654&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;The U.S. Army on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/3729394795/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1654&#34; title=&#34;mission&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mission-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that you do not recognize before you and around you  any but those office-holders whole commissions have been signed by a  minister or a king; and that the men whom God has put above these  office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to follow  out instead of a post to fill—I say that they escape your narrow,  limited field of observation. - The Count of Monte Cristo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the usual question we ask kids—“What do you want  to be when you grow up?”—is the wrong sort of question. Instead, we  should be asking them, “What do you want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Count of Monte Cristo points out in the above  quotation, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who fill  posts and those who pursue missions. The two are not always mutually  exclusive, but they are usually very separate ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, the difference seems to be that a post is limiting while a mission is empowering.</description>
