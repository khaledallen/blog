&lt;p&gt;“I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.” -Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been volunteering as a cat cuddler (yes that is as awesome as it sounds) and a dog walker at the local humane society. My responsibilities involve socializing the abandoned animals. Many people don&#39;t realize how hard it is for a dog or cat to be left behind or given away. The animal feels betrayed and can respond by becoming aggressive or exceedingly timid. It is so sad to see little puppies and kittens hiding scared, though they tend to rebound quickly and make new friends. The hardest thing is seeing an older animal too timid to come out of its cage.</description>
