&lt;p&gt;Every day I find myself surrounded by people who are unhappy with their lot in life. They don&#39;t have the body they want, the job they want, the partner they want, or the skills they want. Every day they want to be something they aren&#39;t, and every day instad of making progress towards their dreams, they distract themselves or rationalize away their inability to have what they want.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need eyes to see. You just need to believe.” - Caroline Casey, TEDWomen, Dec 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is dedicated to my friend Steffi, who just graduated college and who isn’t settling for the conventional aspirations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker above is legally blind, and yet she dreamed  about being a racecar driver. That didn’t work out, but she did ride an  elephant across India and was a very high powered executive for a number  of years. She never let her eyesight slow her down or lower her  expectations for herself. And she certainly never let anyone else’s idea  of what she should be able to do determine what she aimed for.</description>
