&lt;p&gt;This morning while I was practicing Karate by a forest stream (yeah, I do things like that), a duck hen floated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped to watch her go and was struck by how at-home she seemed. If I blocked out the houses at the top of the hill, I could imagine we were out in the untamed wilderness. She didn&#39;t seem bothered by the fact that there were houses and cars and roads just over the hill, nor by the fact that there was a human by her stream. She was a duck, in the river, in the forest, just as things should be.</description>
