      <description>Chi Ku (Eat Bitter) -Chinese proverb, meaning, &#34;to endure hardship to attain a goal&#34;
 I have been in Boulder almost a full year now, and it hasn&#39;t been easy.
I came here thinking it was meant to be. I would show up, tell people that I taught natural movement, and BAM, the money would start rolling in. I would be surrounded by nature and like-minded people, be in the midst of deepening my understanding of ecopsychology, and helping others connect with nature and their bodies.</description>
