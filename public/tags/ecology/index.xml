&lt;p&gt;Know thyself. - Plato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human body is a wonderfully complex organism. It puts even the most refined watches to shame in terms of the technical precision that enables it to run, and the ingeniousness with which the human (or any other) body is put together continues to astound doctors, philosophers, psychologists, biologists, theologians, and anyone else who witnesses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite this deep complexity, &lt;strong&gt;we often treat our bodies like simple machines&lt;/strong&gt;. We believe that we can change one thing without accounting for anything else. This comes across in the many fitness fads of bulking up vs. cutting vs. toning, as if our bodies were cars that could be tweaked and fine-tuned. All you need to do is lift heavier, or follow this one routine, or eat this one superfood, or take cold showers.</description>
