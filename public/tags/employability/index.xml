&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that travel is essential to a complete education. Traveling abroad teaches understanding of other people, cultures and communities, and these types of experiences offer young people a greater ability to be successful in today&#39;s global society. &lt;em&gt;- Michael Palmer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old friend from my days interning at Forbes gave me some interesting advice today. As a well-established manager, she would have been able to make a very good argument for starting to seriously look at a career, putting down professional roots, building up my financial profile and really setting myself up for the long, steady path to independence and security. Instead, she pretty much recommended I risk it all and travel, try to work in some other countries, because, after all at my age and in this economic climate, there isn&#39;t much to lose. &lt;strong&gt;Take the big risks while you&#39;re young&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>
