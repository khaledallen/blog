&lt;p&gt;A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor&#39;s cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. &#34;It&#39;s overfull! No more will go in!&#34; the professor blurted. &#34;You are like this cup,&#34; the master replied, &#34;How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to South Korea to teach English to kids for a year. Adjusting to the new culture has been both humorous and challenging; things that I usually consider very simple have become extremely difficult. Basics of living—eating healthy, exercising regularly, and even basic hygiene—have new rules and best practices that I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had to accept that I really don’t know how to do much around here.</description>
