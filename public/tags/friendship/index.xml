      <description>There isn&#39;t a blog post for today because coping with the displacement caused by the Boulder floods has prevented me from finding the time to write. I did my best with the posts in the last week, but it finally caught up with me.
I do want to express how grateful I am to have such amazing friends, people who were willing to take us in on a moment&#39;s notice. A friend picked us up around 11pm in his car during the height of the flood on Wednesday night, after we&#39;d been evacuated.</description>

      <title>Cash or Friends? Where are Your Priorities?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1668&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Refracted Moments(TM) on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/refractedmoments/223052548/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1668&#34; title=&#34;cash&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cash-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash or friends? Despite our assertion that the latter is more important, our behavior often suggests that we value money more than our relationships. We tend to work ourselves to death, and if there is any time left over, we think about seeing our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best friend is returning home from a year working in West Virginia, in a town that is 3 hours from the nearest interstate, in some of the most beautiful country I’ve ever seen. When he left to go work there, I drove down with him, and now that he is coming back, I’ve offered to drive down to get the rest of his stuff and help him bring it home. He has already driven half of it back, so we will be leaving together to get the rest, spending a week down there, and then driving home again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I explained to some friends that I would be out of town next week, and why, they seemed surprised that I would go to so much trouble just to provide my friend with company on his long drive back and forth.</description>

&lt;p&gt;You follow what you feel inside&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s intuitive, you don&#39;t have to try&lt;br /&gt;
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it takes my breath away&lt;br /&gt;
What you do, so naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the thunder and I am the lightening&lt;br /&gt;
And I love the way you know who you are&lt;br /&gt;
And to me it&#39;s exciting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Selena Gomez, &#34;Naturally&#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine in the services industry is finding the customer relation aspect to be somewhat taxing. No matter how hard she works, there always seems to be some customer who decides to complain anyway. Even when she is doing everything right, someone finds something to criticize. As a very driven individual who always expects the best from herself, she has been trying very hard to rise to the challenges posed and improve her performance, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be helping. Customers still sometimes complain or whine or antagonize her.</description>

      <title>Lessons on Friendship from Camp</title>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_721&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Source: sausyn on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sausyn/2373020779/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-721&#34; title=&#34;friends&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/friends.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have to share the same box -&lt;em&gt;Anon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of my childhood at a wonderful summer camp in Northern Minnesota, where it seemed like everyone was a potential friend and all the friends you made were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/best-friends-for-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;true friends&lt;/a&gt;. How great would that be in real life? So often the friends we make have agendas, or only hang around us at certain times and with certain people. There is often a sense of insincerity, or somewhat impure friendship. But at Summer Camp, the friends you made at horseback riding were just as good for sailing (assuming they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sail), and you could eat with them, camp with them, play games with them, or just sit and watch the lake together. There is a strange and wondrous ease about camp friends that is so rare and hard to find elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Is Facebook controlling who your friends are?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/is-facebook-controlling-who-your-friends-are/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/laptop.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-578&#34; title=&#34;laptop&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/laptop.jpg?w=199&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Something I&#39;ve noticed happened with Facebook and other social networks is that many of the friends I interact with online are not the same ones I&#39;d normally interact with in person. In some cases, they are people I don&#39;t even enjoy being around in person, but are nevertheless fun and interesting to talk to in the sterile little chat box. This got me to thinking about how the mediums we use for social interaction affect that interaction. I&#39;m certainly more flirtatious online than in person, but what if the effects go deeper than tone?</description>

      <title>Best Friends (for Life)</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/best-friends-for-life/</link>

&lt;dl class=&#34;wp-caption alignright&#34;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&#34;wp-caption-dt&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/friends.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked who the people in the canoe on the top banner are. It&#39;s no surprise that one of them is me. The other person is a guy who has been like a brother to me since fifth grade, when I stumbled awkwardly on to the shores of this country, a naive Arab with no clue how to handle this overwhelming America, as it were. He took me under his wing, and attempted (in vain) to teach me the ways of the American schoolboy. Since then, we&#39;ve been through almost everything together: we&#39;ve gotten to the point of mutual hatred, we&#39;ve come to appreciate the man-hug, we got our Eagle Scout badges at the same time and held a joint ceremony, we&#39;ve SCUBA dived together, and undertaken the most sacred of modern manly bonding rituals: Playing through Halo&#39;s Co-op Campaign on Legendary difficulty. He was my inspiration to get better at video games, and sports, and we&#39;ve been up until 3 AM countless times arguing the finer points of moral philosophy.</description>
