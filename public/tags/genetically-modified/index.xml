&lt;p&gt;“The history of free men is never really written by chance but by choice - their choice” - Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/letter-to-the-president/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Letter to the President&lt;/a&gt;, a reader brought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_22449.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article &lt;/a&gt;to my attention, explaining how the organic elite, such entities as Whole Foods, Organic Valley, and Stonyfield Farms, have expressed their acceptance of GM crops. Whole Foods has apparently decided to stop opposing GM crops, and in return they are demanding compensation for farmers. The article also points out that most of Whole Foods products are not organic (no surprise), and that most of them are also contaminated with GM foods (also no surprise, since GM corn soybeans are used to make most of the additives in foods, including soy lecithin, modified food starch, dextrose, xantham gum, etc). So, despite their green image, Whole Foods has a vested interest in keeping labels off of foods with GMOs in them.</description>
