      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/airplane.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-587&#34; title=&#34;airplane&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/airplane.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I just finished watching the movie, &lt;em&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/em&gt;. The main character Ryan Bingham, played by the masterful (and distressingly handsome) George Clooney, is in love with his unattached life. Unburdened by attachments to people, place, or things, he revels in travel and the complete freedom he has. During the movie, he begins to question his life, however, and contemplates something like a commitment to another person. Turns out that he can&#39;t really be a part of another person&#39;s &#39;real life,&#39; and we are left wondering if his entire existence is composed of &#39;in betweens,&#39; or at least whether or not he is capable of functioning except when he is up in the air.</description>
