In this game, the main character, Kratos, begins the game as the recently appointed god of war, replacing Ares. He has all sorts of powers, wears nifty armor, and has a lot going on in his life. But he is not satisfied. Then, Zeus betrays him. There is a scene of Kratos&#39; armor falling apart, leaving him with nothing but a loincloth, some boots, and his weapons, which is the state he goes through most of the game in. He has a single purpose at that point: to enact vengeance on Zeus. Kratos is a relatively small guy, as far as Greek heroes go - in a face off with Theseus, the Thebian towers over Kratos. Most of Kratos&#39; enemies are decked out in fancy armor, carry ridiculous weapons (usually turned on them by the plucky Spartan), and have access to all sorts of assistance and special powers. Kratos is a minimalist. He powers his way through his environment, using his physical strength and his mental cunning, two simple blades, and little else.</description>
