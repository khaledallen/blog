&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to have consistently awesome days, and after much trial and error (most of it documented on this blog), I&#39;ve come up with the following list of activities that seem to contribute to days worth having. The elements are pretty open-ended, and allow for multiple interpretations or ways of meeting the requirements, but they help me make sure I cover all the important bases.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a terrible Wednesday. On that day, I did poorly on a workout I was confident I could do well in. I had to leave Kenpo early because I was so exhausted and beat up, and when I got home, I had a stomach ache. I started panicking about how hungry I was because I thought if I ate food so late I would not be able to sleep, and I was already exhausted. My mom and girlfriend can attest to how immature I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was totally different. It was sunny, for one, and I made sure to get enough sleep. Even though traffic kept me from making some appointments, I brushed it off and wore a smile all day long. I had a great time chaperoning my 7th and 8th grade cross country team, and ended the day tired but not exhausted.&lt;br /&gt;
