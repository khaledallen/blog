      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3866&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/winterroad-e1419626354443.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;winterroad&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;269&#34; /&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you for your continued support in 2014. Every year, I take the opportunity of the holidays to express my gratitude to everyone who has impacted my life in the last twelve months, and since this blog is a big part of my life, you&#39;re one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very rough year for me. After the success of launching my first ebook in 2012 and gaining a big following in 2013, I let my expectations get out of control. I got frustrated and the quality of my writing suffered. I lost focus. I feel like Warrior Spirit has lost a lot of what made it a great blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there were a lot of good things that happened, too. I got engaged, which was a big step for me, reignited my love of games, am taking a chess class (see below), and started work on my novel, which is now almost halfway written. I managed to pay down half of my credit card debt and began working with a money, career, and business coach to take my lofty ambitions and give them some focus. I started an internship, increased my income, and established a regular meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it&#39;s been a good year, but the biggest hole has been the spotty posting here. I know (because you&#39;ve told me) that Warrior Spirit provides a lot of value for its readers, and that gives me a lot to work with. So I&#39;ve committed to getting back to twice-a-week postings, which seems to be the sweet spot based on previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Warrior Spirit in 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assert that anyone can become a hero in his or her community and life, the kind of person that changes the world for those they care about. I have always wanted to support people in doing that by helping them live up to their greatest potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, in 2015, I am making the blog all about that and committing to taking concrete, specific action on helping you achieve your goals, whatever they are, by empowering you to be the best you can be.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <title>Happy Thanksgiving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is hugely underestimated as a practice, but theories as diverse as time psychology and Buddhism encourage us to take some time to reflect on all that we have to be grateful for. Since reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Time Paradox&#34; href=&#34;http://www.thetimeparadox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Time Paradox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;I have made a habit of keeping a gratitude journal in order to re-tool how I viewed my past from a childhood of frustration and loneliness to one of self-empowerment and creative insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to show appreciation to the people who help you out. None of us can change the world on our own, so if we are honest with ourselves, we must realize that we owe a lot of our success to others. If we want to continue receiving that support, it&#39;s a good idea to offer thanks to those who gave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I offer my appreciation and gratitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</description>

      <description>Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the States. Since I am an American, for better or worse, I do celebrate this holiday. After all, it celebrates a brief moment in US history when we had the sense to appreciate the kindness shown by the Native Americans, without whose generosity and hospitality, we would have starved to death in a frigid New England winter. The pilgrims needed food, and the local people helped them out.</description>
