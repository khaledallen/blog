&lt;p&gt;“It is the observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, societies have always gone through cycles of establishment and revolution. The established order, originally meant as liberating, starts to become oppressive in its attempts to institutionalize itself. In turn, revolutionaries rise to oppose the system, to assert individuality and reinstate the balance. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they are incorporated into the existing order, and sometimes they overthrow the current order and establish their own system. We are at a time of revolution, though it is a quiet one.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;We make sacred pact. I promise teach karate to you, you promise learn. I say, you do, no questions.&#34; -Mr. Miyagi, Karate Kid (1984)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad has been baking a lot of bread recently, experimenting with different ingredients and developing his own unique style of bread. When I read his cookbook, I found out why. Instead of simply giving him a bread recipe, the author of his book explains what each step is intended to accomplish: the various factors that determine how much flour to use, how long to let the bread rise, why you let the bread rise, and what occurs in the dough during baking. It borders on chemistry, but the result is that my dad has a much better grasp of why each step must be taken, and can make adjustments to get his desired effect. If he wants to get a crispier crust, he knows what to change and how to compensate to avoid ruining his loaves.</description>
