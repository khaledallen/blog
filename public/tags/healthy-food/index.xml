All they can do is remind themselves that they will be spared the debilitating chronic diseases that will likely afflict their less-disciplined friends. Unfortunetly (or not) it isn&#39;t that simple. Sometimes, those of us with the healthiest of habits end up the victim while our chain smoking, sugar-munching friends live their whole lives without the smallest issues.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I post a lot of talk about food and healthy eating on this blog, so you may be wondering what food has to do with the Warrior lifestyle. After all, it is such a mundane topic. Wouldn&#39;t our time be better spent discussing mental attitudes or physical training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food is important to a Warrior lifestyle because it is the basis of our physical existence. Food is used to contruct our bodies, and to fuel them. In order to be of service to others, and for her own happiness, a Warrior should seek to cultivate and maintain a healthy body. As much as we may deny it, we exist in the physical realm, and so must look after our physical existence to build a strong foundation for our endeavors.</description>
