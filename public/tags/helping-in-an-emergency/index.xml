&lt;p&gt;First off, I apologize for the delayed posting. My internet has been out for two days. Hopefully, things will run more smoothly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening, I was on my way home from work when I had to swerve to avoid a truck pulling into my lane to go around what looked like a stopped car. As I passed, I noticed that it wasn&#39;t a stopped car, but rather an overturned car. There had just been some sort of accident. I quickly pulled over and put on my emergency blinkers, figuring I knew some emergency response and could be of help.</description>
