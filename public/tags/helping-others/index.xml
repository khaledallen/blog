      <description>The problem with charging people for a service is that it limits who is worthy of being helped.
I&#39;ve been in the position of being someone who is really passionate about learning a skill, and would make the perfect student, but who cannot afford something. It never felt fair because it suggests that only rich people can be skilled or learned or whatever.
If I believe that people will benefit from learning how to be more in-tune with their bodies, to move with power and grace, then presumably this applies to all people.</description>

      <title>When Is It Selfish to Help Others?</title>

&lt;p&gt;The most significant lesson I ever learned in trust-based relationships is that all anybody asks for is respect. If you give them that, you have extended the greatest sign of love and compassion there is. If you don’t give them respect, you’re not really loving them. You’re simply looking after them, attached to them, or maybe even taking advantage of them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you think this is obvious, but consider how many times we ‘love’ without giving respect: parents taking care of their children with no concern for what the child wants; codependent couples using each other to bolster their own self-esteem; men and women with a need to rescue their partner or be a hero; friends who hang out together because they look better in comparison to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True respect, true compassion, involves the recognition that the other person is a complete, functional, human being&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if they need help in some things, they are still complete beings.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -Napoleon Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much about the Warrior Spirit is centered around independence and self-sufficiency. I talk a lot about the need to stick to our own convictions and believe in our own dreams. There is a lot of standing up against the tide of mediocrity that tries to bring us back into the fold, a lot of fighting for our best lives and the life we want. So it may come as a bit of a shock when I say that a true Warrior is not complete if he only pursues his own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the purpose of developing the self is so that you can serve others better.</description>
