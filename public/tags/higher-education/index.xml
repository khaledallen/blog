      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in the midst of reading &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance &lt;/em&gt;by Robert M. Pirsig&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and the author spends a lot of time talking about the educational system in the United States, indeed, all of Western civilization. As a recent college graduate, this is something I&#39;ve actually questioned a lot myself. I don&#39;t know about most of my peers, but I never really thought of college as a necessity, or even a forgone conclusion. When I applied to college, I did it in the context of an expectation - I went to a college-prep school and was at the top of my class, everybody at that school expected me to go to college - but I personally did not necessarily want to go to college. I chose to go, consciously, because I was convinced that it would help me achieve my goals. I did, however, entertain other options.</description>
