&lt;p&gt;If we had no choice but to destroy the natural world or destroy ourselves, which do you think we would pick? Let’s say that Nature has decided she has had enough. She won’t kill us outright, but she has determined to eliminate all aspects of our unsustainable lives, which means she sends her warriors to take out our property, vehicles, and infrastructure. Insects would lay waste to crops, sacrificing themselves to the pesticides, leaving organic foods untouched (assuming the crops themselves didn’t turn against us by simply refusing to produce). Rodents would flood our homes, tearing them apart from the inside, leaving us unscathed by demolishing everything manufactured, everything chemically-treated, everything unnatural. Trees and plants would suddenly demonstrate an uncanny determination to grow roots under, over, and into our buildings and roads, slowly but inexorably pulling them to pieces.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Man&#39;s heart away from nature becomes hard.  &lt;em&gt;-Standing Bear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural world is all around us. Every city is merely an island of human habitation amidst a vast sea of countryside and forests. A mere hour outside of New York, one of the biggest metropolises in the world, one can find beautiful and surprisingly isolated parks and hiking trails. The hills around LA are still pretty wild (apparently coyotes are a major concern out there). Most cities have parks, little spaces where the city&#39;s fabric is cut out to reveal the nature underneath, just waiting to burst through into sunlight. These are places people can go to escape the hustle of the city for a while. There is something calming and serene about nature. I always feel complete and more balanced when surrounded by trees, and there is a lot to be said for seeking out a regular connection with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons on Friendship from Camp</title>

&lt;p&gt;We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have to share the same box -&lt;em&gt;Anon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of my childhood at a wonderful summer camp in Northern Minnesota, where it seemed like everyone was a potential friend and all the friends you made were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/best-friends-for-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;true friends&lt;/a&gt;. How great would that be in real life? So often the friends we make have agendas, or only hang around us at certain times and with certain people. There is often a sense of insincerity, or somewhat impure friendship. But at Summer Camp, the friends you made at horseback riding were just as good for sailing (assuming they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sail), and you could eat with them, camp with them, play games with them, or just sit and watch the lake together. There is a strange and wondrous ease about camp friends that is so rare and hard to find elsewhere.</description>
