&lt;p&gt;“A  human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,  butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance  accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give  orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem,  pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently,  die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” - Lazarus Long&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Campbell pointed out in his book &lt;em&gt;Myths to Live By &lt;/em&gt;that,  as humans have become more and more specialized, they have started to  feel like bigger and bigger chunks of their being are empty. When all  you are comfortable doing is studying and researching and you can’t feel  capable in the physical or social realm, you discover big areas of life  completely closed off to you.</description>
