&lt;p&gt;You follow what you feel inside&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s intuitive, you don&#39;t have to try&lt;br /&gt;
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it takes my breath away&lt;br /&gt;
What you do, so naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the thunder and I am the lightening&lt;br /&gt;
And I love the way you know who you are&lt;br /&gt;
And to me it&#39;s exciting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine in the services industry is finding the customer relation aspect to be somewhat taxing. No matter how hard she works, there always seems to be some customer who decides to complain anyway. Even when she is doing everything right, someone finds something to criticize. As a very driven individual who always expects the best from herself, she has been trying very hard to rise to the challenges posed and improve her performance, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be helping. Customers still sometimes complain or whine or antagonize her.</description>
