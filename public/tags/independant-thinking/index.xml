&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a really humorous series of short videos about how to be suave while living at your parents’ house after college. A young man in a bathrobe introduced himself as so many of us graduates do: a list of impressive academic accomplishments, compelling personality traits, a powerful drive for success, and, oh yeah, unemployed and living at home. The narrator then goes on to explain how to ‘be suave’ while living around your parents. For example, dealing with the fact that your mom still does your laundry, or capitalizing on recurring fashion cycles to make use of your dad’s wardrobe.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was reading a short piece on creative motivation last  week that asserted that very few of our thoughts are truly our own.  According to the author, most of what we think falls into the category  of ‘monkey-mind,’ which is a term I recognized from studying Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it refers to the thought process that jumps from  one topic to another without ever really getting anywhere. Like a  distracted monkey in a playpen, the mind simply takes up whatever  catches its interest for a moment. It may play with the idea for a  while, but quickly discards it for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with true clarity of thought in which the  mind is focused on a singular aim at the exclusion of all else. By  remaining focused and mostly empty, the clear mind can direct all its  energies to accomplishing some task or plan.</description>
