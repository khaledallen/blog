&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on feedback after the original version of this article, I realized that some of what I said was not expressed clearly and could be interpreted as devaluing people&#39;s accomplishments. I was also jumping to conclusions in some cases and generalizing. I meant no disrespect to any of my readers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases of doctors and surgeons who rise to the top of their peer groups, gaining renown for the medical problems they are able to solve. They earn the respect and admiration of their peers and the deep appreciation of the patients they save. Then, one day, it is discovered that they never went to medical school, and in fact forged their diplomas. They are stopped from practicing of course, and some are arrested. But everyone who knows them maintains that they were excellent doctors. They simply didn&#39;t have the correct paperwork.</description>
