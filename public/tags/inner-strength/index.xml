&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” - Buddha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I entertained lofty notions of fixing many of the world’s problems. However, I did not feel up to the task. Despite my ambitions, I felt fearful and weak. Whenever I contemplated tackling the big issues, I saw them as far beyond my capabilities. &lt;strong&gt;But instead of focusing on increasing my capabilities, I instead tried to think of ways I could tackle these challenges with just what I had at the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was that I felt constantly overwhelmed. In high school, I spent most of my time despairing how ineffective I was. In college, I did what a lot of people do: I stopped caring and focused on enjoying my life, often through distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I &lt;a title=&#34;The Night That Changed My Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-night-that-changed-my-life/&#34;&gt;received a Warrior calling&lt;/a&gt; that brought my life back on track. As I started training my body, and developing emotional and mental strength, I found myself becoming more confident and outgoing. Problems that had overwhelmed me no longer did, and I felt a noticeable increase in my sense of effectiveness. My grades improved, even as I took on more extra-curricular activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A New Path for a Wimpy Kid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up on this, I looked for other areas in which I could cultivate inner strength. After college, I returned to my study of self-defense and systematically improved my people skills. The following year, I set my sights on &lt;a title=&#34;Empty Your Cup: Accepting Ignorance to Learn&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/empty-your-cup-accepting-ignorance-to-learn/&#34;&gt;living and working in Korea&lt;/a&gt; to foster the ability to live independantly. I took on the challenges of expanding this blog and &lt;a title=&#34;Warrior Spirit Principles of Holistic Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/store/warrior-spirit-principles-of-holistic-health/&#34;&gt;writing a book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All this was done with an eye towards increasing my sense of empowerment and convincing myself that &lt;a title=&#34;Your Mountain is Waiting. Do You Dare Conquer it?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/your-mountain-is-waiting-do-you-dare-conquer-it/&#34;&gt;my dreams were within my grasp&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps more importantly, worth pursuing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result has been a tremendous increase in my strength of purpose and my faith in my ability to effect positive change in the world.</description>
