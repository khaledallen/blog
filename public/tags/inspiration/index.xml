      <title>How to Be Accepted as a Leader</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3944&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/125H-e1424150911303.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;125H&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;288&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;I&#39;m the one chance you&#39;ve got of staying alive.&#34; - Clara Oswald, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, Season 8, &lt;em&gt;Flatline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&#39;ve run into this problem: You want to make a difference in the world by inspiring, motivating, and supporting the people around you, but you aren&#39;t in charge. You don&#39;t feel like anyone is paying attention to your ideas or giving you permission to start a new project that might take the business in a new direction, or even start a new company that would change the face of the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you just keep on working at whatever you do, coloring in the lines, and dreaming about the day you get to take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult place to be because you have great ideas and strong convictions, but you are afraid that if you take action on them, you will upset people. You aren&#39;t sure if they are happy where they are, and even if they aren&#39;t, change is always scary. You don&#39;t want to be the one to bring that on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, while change is scary, it is also inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might as well be the one to direct it and help people grow with it, rather than resist and stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you get over the leadership hump to get others on board and make a difference?</description>

      <title>How I Turn Fear into Inspiration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/skull.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-3084&#34; alt=&#34;skull&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/skull-202x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;202&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;ve been struggling with my mortality lately. Every few years, I go through periods of my life when I&#39;m hyperaware that I won&#39;t be around forever, that this is my only chance to live, and afterwards it will be Eternity of....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#39;m not unique in this way. All humans know they are going to die, and that awareness has been a driving force in human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how other people respond to that reality. I experience a compression of time, and all of a sudden, the decades between now and my death seem utterly trivial, the end as urgent and imminent as the next five minutes. It&#39;s really unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe in more compassionate explanations of existence than the walking-bag-of-chemical-reactions-becomes-worm-food. The Buddhist and Taoist concepts of universal oneness have a ring of truth to me. Of course, knowing that intellectually is very different from knowing it as a foundational principle of your worldview. Despite everything, I have to admit the dark, hopeless view often seems more real to me, even if it doesn&#39;t really make sense based on my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This awareness of the &lt;a title=&#34;The Imminence of Death&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-immanence-of-death/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;imminence of death&lt;/a&gt; has been a defining feature of my life since I was very young. It has shaped my worldview and left a strong impression on my sense of values. For a long time, I simply accepted it as a terrible curse, but &lt;strong&gt;I eventually realized that I could choose what it meant to me&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I chose to to interpret it in a way that empowers me and allows me to be happy.</description>

      <title>Velvet Ropes</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/velvet-ropes/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5848124382_4f8b14264e.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1990&#34; title=&#34;Velvet ropes ready to hold you back&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/5848124382_4f8b14264e.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It&#39;s opener there, in the wide open air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out there things happen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And frequently do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To people as brainy and footsy as you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Dr. Seuss, &lt;em&gt;Oh the Places You&#39;ll Go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a place where travelers go, full of wonder and exotic foods and people. Conveniently, everyone speaks English when you need to communicate, but they maintain their quant, authentic accent and obligingly speak in their native tongue among themselves. They can show you around, if you can pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a new, distant country, so you&#39;re guaranteed an adventure, and you can rest secure in the knowledge that you are widening your horizons, being cosmopolitan, and expanding your mind. Perhaps many of your friends are still at home, taking vacations to safe, boring places like Florida or Yosemite. But in this country, you can See Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get very, very comprehensive guide books, written by Seasoned Travelers, and so presented from a perspective you&#39;d understand. There are signs, too, printed so you can read them. The books and the signs will tell you all the best places to go, so you can be sure you won&#39;t miss out on the Complete Experience. Every tourist who comes through has seen these most wondrous sights, and if you didn&#39;t, you&#39;d be missing out. It&#39;s really very easy anyway, so why not just follow the signs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paths are well-marked, and well-trodden. They are paved and kept in good condition (but with careful attention to preserving the suggestion of age, the patina of local culture). You won&#39;t trip or sprain an ankle. All the best restaurants are on these paths, and plenty of comfortable, accommodating places to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the countryside, you ask?</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Listen to the Haters</title>

“Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” -Albert Einstein
 The hardest thing I’ve encountered in becoming happy and successful is that it can make other people upset. Even if most people are happy for you, that one voice of resentment can destroy you.
That provides a great excuse to hold yourself back: we’d rather be liked than happy (the absurdity of that statement should be apparent).</description>

      <title>Living an Adventurous Life</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/living-an-adventurous-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1511&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Gjeewaytee on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/40066970@N08/4178946564/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1511&#34; title=&#34;adventure&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/adventure-300x226.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;226&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started learning gymnastics, I wasn&#39;t the only adult at the gym. But I was the only adult on the rings and I was the only person there with no formal gymnastics experience as a child (excluding the Parkour crowd and one other guy who had started in college).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my previous experience, my age, and my chosen apparatus of still rings, there weren&#39;t many who thought I would go far. After all, there weren&#39;t many (if any) who had come into gymnastics late with the intent of picking up much beyond tumbling and flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my coach and I moved slowly, exploring different ways to progress and learn that might be unique to my situation. Every training session was an adventure, because I didn&#39;t know anyone who had done what I was trying to do. I didn&#39;t know what to expect, or how I would ultimately fare.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Words Carefully</title>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;We cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.&#34; - Florence Scovel Shinn Artist, Teacher and Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words we use to convey our thoughts and describe our lives influence the way we see the world to a greater extent than most of us realize. It may not seem like a big difference, but choosing to use one word or descriptor over another can help you overcome negative or constraining worldviews. Think about how you talk about your goals. Do you refer to them as dreams or as concrete objectives? Do you talk to yourself in the first or second person? Do you refer to other people using condescending terms (&#39;girls&#39; for all women)? Such subtle changes in the language you use will, over time, change the way you think about people and how others deal with you.</description>

      <title>The Process of Living</title>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;The journey is what brings us happiness not the destination.&#34; -&lt;em&gt;Dan Millman, The Peaceful Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the overriding themes that I refer to a lot is the idea that many important endeavors are ongoing. There is no end goal in mind, and having an end goal can often derail our efforts to improve. Instead, simply going through your routine, growing slowly and naturally, will get you where you want to go with less frustration and less pain.</description>

      <title>What Do You Call Yourself?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/what-do-you-call-yourself/</link>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_772&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Source: pinprick on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/nametag.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-772&#34; title=&#34;nametag&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nametag-300x210.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They stick you with those names, those labels -- ‘rebel’ or whatever; whatever they like to use. Because they need a label; they need a name. They need something to put the price tag on the back of.” - Johnny Depp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask you what you do, what do you say? What would you like to say? Most people answer with their current job: &#34;I am a personal trainer,&#34; or &#34;I sell commodities,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m a homemaker.&#34; These sorts of answers are sufficient to move the conversation along, but most people &#39;do&#39; so much more than their job. Perhaps the question is actually a poorly worded version of, &#34;What is your job?&#34; I think that is only because of habit. I don&#39;t think most people care if you answer with your job or some other activity that occupies your time. So why not give an answer that really describes what it is you do?</description>
