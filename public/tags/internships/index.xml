Sent out dozens of applications, trolled family contacts, bugged family friends, tried my hand at insurance, utilized alumni connections, everything I could think of. I don&#39;t even know how many Craigslist ads I responded to (in quite a bit of detail I might add). I went through a long and intense interview process for a job that would have set me down an amazing career in diplomacy and provided an astounding starting salary, only to be told eventually I lacked experience. My hopes have been dashed against the rocks more times than I want to count, but, with nothing else to do, I kept at it.</description>
