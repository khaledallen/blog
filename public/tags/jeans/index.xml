      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3923&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Jeans-e1422508471220.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jeans&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;246&#34; /&gt;One day, I needed new pants. The jeans I&#39;d been wearing were so torn up I was ashamed to wear them. I went to Macy&#39;s and bought the jeans I thought I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; own: Levi&#39;s 501s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so enamored of the label that I didn&#39;t even consider other options, determined to fit into this arbitrary definition of &#39;cool&#39; even if it felt miserable, which it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have weird proportions. I&#39;m tall and lanky with a narrow waist, which is difficult enough (try finding 31x34 pants anywhere). Add to that the fact that my thighs and glutes are big for my size thanks to weightlifting and I&#39;m impossible to fit. I felt like the Tin Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I stubbornly biked around in my Real Jeans, feeling good about my authentic denim and that little red tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the hip pain started and I had to admit that I couldn&#39;t sacrifice my comfort to fit into a pair of pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one pair of pants I&#39;ve owned that actually felt and looked really good. They were prAna jeans, which I could get from a local store. They were expensive, had spandex in them, and were so self-consciously stylish, there was no way I could wear them, but I decided to try them on anyway.</description>
