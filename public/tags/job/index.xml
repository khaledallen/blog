&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m happy to announce that I have finally landed a job in Boulder, which means that I can stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, &lt;a title=&#34;Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;keeping upbeat&lt;/a&gt; in the face of difficult prospects has been hard. Especially going into March, which would have been the limit of my savings, I was worried I was going to hit a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luckily, just as I reached the end of my financial rope, a job came through&lt;/strong&gt;. Funny how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, now I have the issue of having too many things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual workaday job at the grocery store, I was also given my first tutoring assignment, and landed my first paid freelance magazine article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Freeing the Zoo Humans: Why I Want to Become a MovNat Instructor&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/movnat-instructor/&#34;&gt;Coaching MovNat&lt;/a&gt; is still my preferred form of employment, but that hasn&#39;t resulted in any paying arrangements. However, I&#39;m still giving it as much attention as I can spare, going around to gyms and studios offering to run workshops and introduce myself to as wide an audience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that I will use the consistent job to get established while developing more lucrative opportunities that allow me to work on my own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period of my life is certainly one of the most challenging and uncomfortable, but I can tell it is also fostering a lot of growth. It&#39;s the kind of uncomfortable experience that you know is good for you, even if you&#39;d rather not have to go through it. Sort of like exercise (which I guess I&#39;m fairly good at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few short lessons I&#39;ve learned:</description>

      <title>Thinking Outside the Box You Built Yourself</title>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1016&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;262&#34; caption=&#34;Steve Keys on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/boxes.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1016&#34; title=&#34;boxes&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/boxes-262x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;262&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are people who put their dreams in a little box and say, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve got dreams, of course I&#39;ve got dreams.&#34; Then they put the box away and bring it out once in awhile to look in it, and yep, they&#39;re still there.” -Emma Bombeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little kid, I was taught that I could not support myself doing something fun that I loved. I would have to find a job that tediously &#39;contributed&#39; to society in order to make enough money so I&#39;d have the resources to spend my free time engaged in enjoyable &#39;hobbies&#39;. Life would always be a trade off between doing what you had to, based on what someone else deemed was a valuable use of your time, and doing what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve begun to question the assumption that doing something you enjoy is a poor way to make money. Of course, if you&#39;re really lucky, you&#39;ll end up in a job you love, so money-making will be bearable, but the emphasis was on fitting yourself into a job, rather than the other way around.</description>

      <title>Freedom-Promoting Jobs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; caption=&#34;Candlemaker on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/5/8016593_21260c4b3f.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; &#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/8016593_21260c4b3f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a repost of an article I wrote for another blog on career advice for young people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just have to do your own thing, no matter what anyone says. It&#39;s your life.” &lt;em&gt;- Ethan Embry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons out there why you would want to avoid a job like the plague. After all, there is a reason Robert Kiyosaki, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.wordpress.com/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, refers to the dreaded word as a mere acronym for &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;ust &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;ver &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;roke. Nevertheless, getting a job is the easiest way there is to make money, if not necessarily the most desirable, and as such is an invaluable method for providing the necessary foundation to jump off to freedom. Let’s be ridiculous and say we want a job with few hours, lots of freedom, and plenty of money. Where on earth do you find one like that? Before we go on, let me define what exactly I mean when I say Job.</description>
