&lt;p&gt;You follow what you feel inside&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s intuitive, you don&#39;t have to try&lt;br /&gt;
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it takes my breath away&lt;br /&gt;
What you do, so naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the thunder and I am the lightening&lt;br /&gt;
And I love the way you know who you are&lt;br /&gt;
And to me it&#39;s exciting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine in the services industry is finding the customer relation aspect to be somewhat taxing. No matter how hard she works, there always seems to be some customer who decides to complain anyway. Even when she is doing everything right, someone finds something to criticize. As a very driven individual who always expects the best from herself, she has been trying very hard to rise to the challenges posed and improve her performance, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be helping. Customers still sometimes complain or whine or antagonize her.</description>

      <title>What Do You Call Yourself?</title>

&lt;p&gt;“They stick you with those names, those labels -- ‘rebel’ or whatever; whatever they like to use. Because they need a label; they need a name. They need something to put the price tag on the back of.” - Johnny Depp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask you what you do, what do you say? What would you like to say? Most people answer with their current job: &#34;I am a personal trainer,&#34; or &#34;I sell commodities,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m a homemaker.&#34; These sorts of answers are sufficient to move the conversation along, but most people &#39;do&#39; so much more than their job. Perhaps the question is actually a poorly worded version of, &#34;What is your job?&#34; I think that is only because of habit. I don&#39;t think most people care if you answer with your job or some other activity that occupies your time. So why not give an answer that really describes what it is you do?</description>

      <title>Never Work a Day in Your Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/worker.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-411&#34; title=&#34;worker&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/worker.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some jobs you would do regardless of whether you were paid or not. And then there are some jobs you would only do if you were paid. I&#39;m a little shocked and terrified at the number of people who are paid to perform the functions necessary to making our civilization run, who perform jobs I can&#39;t imagine spending eight years of my life doing. I am torn between admiration for their ability to keep upbeat and cheerful and pity at the sheer tedium of their jobs. But we all have to make a living.</description>
