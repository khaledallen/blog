      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/gHIn4zYZpZ4&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing on the broken edge of the Earth that had been thrust up out of the ground thousands of years ago but still as jagged as ever, I gazed across a chasm occluded by falling snow. On the other side was wild mountain forest, filling in the gaps of another chunk of tectonic rock that had been forcibly pried into the sky by the Rockies beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could think of no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;This was the life I wanted for myself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I were honest, I would never have brought myself out here on my own. I owed the motivation for this trip to a new friend, and to the community that makes a spur-of-the-moment jaunt into the mountains a reasonable possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to my own devices, I would have been at home, safely tucked into my comfort zone, watching the snow fall and wondering if I was really living up to the Boulder lifestyle.</description>
