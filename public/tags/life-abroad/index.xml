      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“You’re on your own, and you know what you know, and you are the guy who’ll decide where to go” -- Dr. Seuss, Oh the Places You’ll Go!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been living, on our own, in Korea for 6 months at this point, which is one half of our planned stay.  More than being a cultural experience, these past months have been an exploration of personal growth. My girlfriend and I have learned a lot about choosing our own paths and the little things that make a self-directed life.&lt;/p&gt;
