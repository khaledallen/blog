&lt;p&gt;“They stick you with those names, those labels -- ‘rebel’ or whatever; whatever they like to use. Because they need a label; they need a name. They need something to put the price tag on the back of.” - Johnny Depp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask you what you do, what do you say? What would you like to say? Most people answer with their current job: &#34;I am a personal trainer,&#34; or &#34;I sell commodities,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m a homemaker.&#34; These sorts of answers are sufficient to move the conversation along, but most people &#39;do&#39; so much more than their job. Perhaps the question is actually a poorly worded version of, &#34;What is your job?&#34; I think that is only because of habit. I don&#39;t think most people care if you answer with your job or some other activity that occupies your time. So why not give an answer that really describes what it is you do?</description>
