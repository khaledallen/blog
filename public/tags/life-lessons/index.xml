&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve been helping out at the CT Humane Society for a few months now, and have spent a lot of time with really adorable, heartbreakingly cute kitties and puppies that want nothing more than to play and be loved. Yeah, it&#39;s rough work, but someone&#39;s got to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve learned a lot of important things from these animals, both from their suffering and the little joys they manage to find in life at the shelter. Here are some examples:</description>

&lt;p&gt;All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sand pile at school. &lt;em&gt;- Robert Fulghum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children give you a lot of perspective on life. They are impossible to keep in order, except when you do seemingly trivial and silly things. They seem very rude and uncouth most of the time, but the best way to get them to do what you want is simply to ask nicely. They remind you what&#39;s important in life, and the importance of friends, food, and enough rest. They also teach you how to appreciate the little things in life, like the wonder of floating on a surfboard in the sun (something I find endlessly tedious) and how stupid things can be really, legitimately funny.</description>
