      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I took the Landmark Forum. For those of you who don&#39;t know, Landmark is a personal development coaching workshop that has a reputation for being confrontational. I wasn&#39;t a fan of their coaching method, but I certainly did learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that forms the core of the Landmark approach to life is that life is meaningless, and that this fact is itself meaningless (which is kind of a clever solution to the problem, though it becomes contradictory considering the intention behind making the statement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve been on Warrior Spirit for a while, you know that I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working on the idea that life has no inherent meaning. The conclusion I came to, and that which Landmark offered, is that we create the meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that is a simplistic answer that fails to capture the true nature of being, a creative, artistic act.</description>
