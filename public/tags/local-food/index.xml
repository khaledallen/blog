      <title>Book Review: The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/omnivore.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1799&#34; title=&#34;omnivore&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/omnivore.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;194&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of all the animals in the world, certainly we have the widest selection of possible foods; we can eat meat, vegetables, grains, legumes, dairy, and even industrial chemicals (apparently). And yet while a squirrel can look at an acorn and know instinctively that it is good to eat, we have to consider our food options. With so much variety, the only way we know what is good to eat and what isn’t is through trial and error, cultural norms, and our sense of taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the omnivore’s dilemma, and it forms the basis for the book by Michael Pollan, which explores how we modern humans produce, acquire, and prepare our food.</description>

&lt;p&gt;With the recent trouble over the approval of GM alfalfa, we have been faced with the reality of a very un-sustainable agriculture in this country. Incidentally, the use of GM crops also threatens our health, but what about other circumstnaces where we must seemingly choose between health and sustainability? Does it make sense to adopt an eating pattern that promotes optimal health if it requires us to eat in a way that is detrimental to the planet and our society?</description>

&lt;p&gt;“A little rebellion now and then... is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.”- Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/healthy-living-join-the-health-_b_799191.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;claiming that being healthy is a revolutionary act, a difficult process that necessitates you make choices that put you in opposition to the mainstream and the social norm. To be healthy requires you be willing to ostracise yourself in the name of your own well-being because the sad truth is that our society has made poor health the trend and the norm.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is the observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, societies have always gone through cycles of establishment and revolution. The established order, originally meant as liberating, starts to become oppressive in its attempts to institutionalize itself. In turn, revolutionaries rise to oppose the system, to assert individuality and reinstate the balance. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they are incorporated into the existing order, and sometimes they overthrow the current order and establish their own system. We are at a time of revolution, though it is a quiet one.</description>

      <title>Time Magazine Explodes the Organic Myth, Kind Of</title>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; arrived in the mail. And right on the cover was a blurb about an article on &#34;The Organic Food Debate.&#34; I have some familiarity with the so called &#39;debate.&#39; It basically boils down to this: organic/clean/sustainable/local food is great in theory, but it is too expensive/elitist/not scalable. I have seen this sort of article several times, so I had a pretty good idea of the arguments to come, but I credit &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;with a willingness to tackle tough issues and the integrity to present ambivalent conclusions. So I turned to the page and started reading.</description>
