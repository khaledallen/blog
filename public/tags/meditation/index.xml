      <title>A 10 Minute Exercise that Will Change Your Day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3907&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/watch-e1421889550877.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;watch&#34; width=&#34;698&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;Imagine what your life would be like and what you&#39;d accomplish if you started &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day full of passion, purpose and drive. Not just a few days a month, or a few hours of each day, but every hour of every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re probably thinking that&#39;d be great, but it&#39;s not realistic. After all, moods and mindsets are fickle, and people are either born with drive or they&#39;re not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself asking the same question recently, and I decided to see if I could find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my research on high achieving individuals, from the ultra-wealthy to the ultra-accomplished, I noticed that the biggest difference was their mindset. They ask different kinds of questions and see the world in a different way than the majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For an example of this, check out &lt;a title=&#34;KhanAcademy Interviews Elon Musk&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwzmJpI4io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sal Khan&#39;s interview of Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me that an essential technique for increasing people&#39;s capabilities was to find a way for them to consistently elevate their mindset. Each day spent in a state of openness to possibility compounds on the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, for most of us, our mindset is determined by our mood, which is often determined by the events of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to make sure that every day started with an empowered mindset.</description>

      <title>3 Life-Changing Lessons from Meditating Daily</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/3-life-changing-lessons-from-meditating-daily/</link>

      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Meditation is such a simple act--you just sit in one place and concentrate on your breathing--yet it is also extremely difficult. It can teach you so much about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Over the years, I’ve gone through periods when I meditated regularly and times when I just couldn’t bring myself to sit on the cushion. Even when I was meditating, I’ve gone through periods when I was the easiest thing in the world, and I just couldn’t wait to sit. Other times, I would put it off as long as possible, then drag myself to the cushion, and every second felt like an unbearable eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Through all that, I’ve learned a lot of really powerful lessons from sitting and breathing. Three of them have helped me in many other areas of life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My feelings don’t define me or my world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discomfort isn&#39;t always bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routine matters</description>

      <title>Meditating When You Don&#39;t Have the Time</title>

      <description>I was at the end of a particularly difficult workout, but I was confident because the final movement was one that I was especially good at: muscle-ups.
I ran over to the rings, jumped up and ripped out a single rep. I went for my second--and failed. I tried again--and failed. The clock was running out, so I didn&#39;t waste time with chalking my hands, collecting myself, or even setting my grip correctly.</description>

      <title>Start Your Day Right with an Anchor</title>

&lt;p&gt;The image of the lone warrior training every day at dawn is a popular one in the martial arts. Like clockwork, the Warrior rises before her companions have even stirred to run through her training. She does this in the mornings, so that there is no possibility of distraction. It is her source of strength, for even in the midst of a quest, she finds time to hone her skills and focus her mind for the day&#39;s coming struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel frustrated by the inconsistency in your days? While change and excitement are great, I&#39;ve always found that I really appreciate having at least a few things that are steady that I can turn to in order to get into the right mindset for the day. Alternatively, having something later in the day that I can expect helps me forget all the troubles and problems that have cropped up. An afternoon run will do wonders to help you put the stresses of a long workday behind you so that you can focus your energies on being with your family in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
