      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1805&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Astragony on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/astragony/4841649944/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1805&#34; title=&#34;ModelinRome&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ModelinRome-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women do not have it easy in our society. For example, they get &lt;a title=&#34;Miss Representation&#34; href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=2349117563337&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;objectified&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&#34;Why a Woman Can Never Win Against a Man&#34; href=&#34;http://www.care2.com/causes/why-a-woman-can-never-win-against-a-man.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;have their world records revoked&lt;/a&gt;, and are underrepresented in American government. Nobody thinks these things are okay (and if you do, you suck). Women also have to put up with an unrealistic and extremely narrow definition of beauty. Yet a lot of men see no reason to work to change they way they see women or deal with them. Would you boycott almost every show on TV? Would you date a girl you respected, even if she wasn’t stereotypically sexual? Would you turn down the svelte, leggy blonde for the intelligent, athletic brunette?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, for many men, the answer is no, even if they would prefer to meet the latter lady. The result is that a lot of women feel that they aren’t desirable unless they look a particular way. The problem doesn’t just affect women, however.</description>

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you have asked who the people in the canoe on the top banner are. It&#39;s no surprise that one of them is me. The other person is a guy who has been like a brother to me since fifth grade, when I stumbled awkwardly on to the shores of this country, a naive Arab with no clue how to handle this overwhelming America, as it were. He took me under his wing, and attempted (in vain) to teach me the ways of the American schoolboy. Since then, we&#39;ve been through almost everything together: we&#39;ve gotten to the point of mutual hatred, we&#39;ve come to appreciate the man-hug, we got our Eagle Scout badges at the same time and held a joint ceremony, we&#39;ve SCUBA dived together, and undertaken the most sacred of modern manly bonding rituals: Playing through Halo&#39;s Co-op Campaign on Legendary difficulty. He was my inspiration to get better at video games, and sports, and we&#39;ve been up until 3 AM countless times arguing the finer points of moral philosophy.</description>

The author undertook to learn the ways of pickup artists for a year, ended up becoming one of the greatest pickup artists in the world (according to an internal rating), developed his own system, and eventually stepped out. He then wrote a book about his experiences, triggering a massive outpouring of additional pickup methods, books, how-to&#39;s, workshops, dating coaching seminars, etc.</description>
