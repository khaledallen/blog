      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-Education-of-Millionaires.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1844&#34; title=&#34;The-Education-of-Millionaires&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/The-Education-of-Millionaires-198x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;198&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every now and then, a book comes along that redefines the way you see the world. Michael Ellsberg&#39;s book is just such a one. It snares you with its controversial premise: &lt;strong&gt;higher education fails to provide the skills necessary to be successful in the real world&lt;/strong&gt;. It keeps you reading by explaining what skills you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;need and how to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has every wondered why, with their expensive degree and pristine grades, they are stuck working meaningless jobs that make no use of their skills, this book provides both the answer and the solution to bettering their chances to make it. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Education of Millionaires&#34; href=&#34;http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/education-of-millionaires-michael-ellsberg/1103297348?ean=9781591844204&amp;amp;itm=1&amp;amp;usri=the+education+of+millionaires&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Education of Millionaires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basically presents a course list for success in business and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a strong advocate of &lt;a title=&#34;The Principles of &#39;Good&#39; Business&#34; href=&#34;http://wp.me/p15g8X-tF&#34;&gt;business with integrity&lt;/a&gt; and success as a means to make a positive difference in the world.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be” -George Sheehan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a series three books on how to change the world, how to give as much as possible to your community, and how to help others get the things they need. The first was a book on how to become wealthy, the second was a book about becoming indispensable to your company, and the third was simply a book about selling. Yes, these were business books, but not business books in the way I usually think about the genre.</description>
