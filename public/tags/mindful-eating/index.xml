When we settled down to farm, we still had to work hard all year to ensure we had enough. Food was needed to live, but we also paid a high price to acquire it. So, when we ate it, we respected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how healthy I eat, I never seem to enjoy the &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt; when all I can think about is the &lt;em&gt;nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. I never realized how important it is to bring some compassion to mealtime in order to truly benefit from eating. This attitude elevates eating from mere consumption for the sake of maintenance, to true Nourishment, that gives us the energy to rise above lifeâ€™s challenges, instead of simply enduring them.</description>
