      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3880&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/timeclock-e1420568994227.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;timeclock&#34; width=&#34;700&#34; height=&#34;245&#34; /&gt;Last week, I shared &lt;a title=&#34;My 2015 Strategy Part 1: Dreams and Aspirations&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/my-2015-strategy-part-1-dreams-and-aspirations/&#34;&gt;my overarching strategy for 2015&lt;/a&gt; and how I got there, with a simple, but very helpful exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I was planning to talk about specific actions and the structures I&#39;m going to put into place to support my plans, but it became a longer article than I&#39;d expected. So, I&#39;m going to limit it to logistics now, and actions on Thursday, because dreams without action will stay that way, and action without logistics will fizzle out real fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize not everyone here is a military history buff (or UPS admirer), so you may not be entirely familiar with what logistics are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, logistics are the support systems that enable an army to do its job. This includes things like food, transportation systems, and even lifestyle. The best trained Navy SEAL is useless without the entire support system that puts him in the right place to start his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your personal life, it is important to create a system to support you. This includes things like your habits, your environment, and your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good logistics are just as essential as good strategy and good tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with last week&#39;s post was that I didn&#39;t account for time, energy, or financial resources; I simply wrote down everything I want to do in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this week, I&#39;ll show you how to handle the rest.</description>

      <title>Are You in the 1%? You Should Be</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/are-you-in-the-1-you-should-be/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an old story of a Roman, Cincinnatus, who was called upon by the Senate in an emergency. Rome&#39;s army had been trapped in the field, leaving the city vulnerable to an attack, and the government nominated Cincinnatus as dictator, giving him 6 months of absolute power. He defeated the enemy in 16 days and immediately gave up his office to return to his farm, becoming a legend of civic virtue and restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate the word &#39;dictator&#39; with a corrupt, power-hungry leader, and that is certainly what most Roman dictators were. But the lesson here is that the office of dictator, and later of emperor, was sullied by the corrupt men who sought and held it, not by the nature of its duties. There were some dictators of sound principles, and some emperors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I watched the documentary &lt;em&gt;Park Avenue,&lt;/em&gt; which is about the wealth gap in America and the political landscape that has made it so entrenched. I&#39;m not especially politically aware (something I&#39;m working on), so it was shocking to see just how bad things are. The 400 richest Americans control as much wealth as 50% of the country, 150 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&#39;ve thought this was just the way our system worked: campaigning was expensive, so businesses and wealthy individuals took advantage of this to offer contributions in exchange for laws that further entrenched their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&#39;t know was that in 1971, soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell wrote a letter to the US Chamber of Commerce, a call-to-arms to US businesses to take a more active role in shaping policy. This was in response to the sweeping political setbacks that had been experienced by corporations in the 60s and early 70s. They heeded the call, and corporate lobbying began to take on the shape it has today.&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;Thus, our current system of government-by-corporation was not the result of a broken system, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;was directly pursued by the corporations themselves in response to a perceived threat to their power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result has been the shrinking of the middle class, a huge growth in the income gap, and a polarization of American society between the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be wealthy in this country is to benefit from corrupt politics and to be a part of a system that oppresses the American people. Or so we have come to believe.</description>

      <title>Investing in Yourself</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/investing-in-yourself/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You experience a windfall and suddenly, your bank account is $1000 fatter. It&#39;s not a ton of money, but it&#39;s enough to give you some breathing room in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you pay off some of your student debt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you take a trip to India?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you buy a new dress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;a title=&#34;You May Be Illiterate&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-may-be-illiterate/&#34;&gt;learn how to program&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us would spend our money on things we want to fill a need or something we want to &lt;a title=&#34;How Much Do You Cost? How Much Do You Create?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-much-do-you-cost-how-much-do-you-create/&#34;&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if our default mode of spending was to invest in ourselves. Instead of having money leak out of the system, keep it in a cycle to generate more and more. Find ways to convert cash into personal capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Use that money to make yourself more valuable or increase your ability to generate value.</description>

      <title>The Problem With Money and Helping People</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/the-problem-with-money-and-helping-people/</link>

      <description>The problem with charging people for a service is that it limits who is worthy of being helped.
I&#39;ve been in the position of being someone who is really passionate about learning a skill, and would make the perfect student, but who cannot afford something. It never felt fair because it suggests that only rich people can be skilled or learned or whatever.
If I believe that people will benefit from learning how to be more in-tune with their bodies, to move with power and grace, then presumably this applies to all people.</description>

      <title>The Things That Matter</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/the-things-that-matter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/the-things-that-matter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-things-that-matter/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2674&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-2674&#34; title=&#34;A moment of pure bliss&#34; alt=&#34;Two dogs and a glass of wine&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a way to live responsibly. Knowing all the suffering and pollution caused by industrial farming and how that impacted my health, I made the commitment to eating organic and supporting local food whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify my decision-making, I made up all sorts of rules about what I could and couldn&#39;t eat. Soon, adhering to the rules became more important than what the rules were meant to help me accomplish, which was eating in harmony. This harmonious way of eating would naturally give rise to health, but when I ran into the Paleo and Primal communities, health itself took the top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the obsession over good vs. bad carbs, optimal post-workout nutrition, and coconut substitutions for everything, I realized my diet had become meaningless. By all accounts, I ate well. My food was high quality and nutritious, but all this was lost on me. &lt;strong&gt;I didn&#39;t even taste my meals anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&#39;t know how common this is among Paleo eaters and I hope you will leave comments sharing your experiences. It seems to me that obsessing over the health aspects of Paleo (dangerously easy to do given the mindset of the community) could lead us to forget how to enjoy our food for its own sake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventually, I came to believe that &lt;a title=&#34;You Can’t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-cant-afford-to-be-attached-to-your-health-so-make-it-about-others/&#34;&gt;my health doesn&#39;t matter&lt;/a&gt;, per se. I didn&#39;t live to be healthy. I was healthy in order to live well. &lt;/strong&gt;How I ate needed to be a reflection of that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear.&#34; - His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I realized that, I stopped getting so upset with the dietary rules. Eventually, I was able to reconnect with the enjoyment of my food again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, as you get deeper into Paleo, you realize that optimal health requires eating and living sustainably. So, even if your main priority is health, you are forced to aim higher, to prioritize something more general, in order to achieve that. The reality forces a widening of your concerns. If you refuse to see this, you end up chasing your own tail in a never-ended spiral of healthy living.</description>

      <title>Cash or Friends? Where are Your Priorities?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/cash-or-friends-where-are-your-priorities/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1668&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Refracted Moments(TM) on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/refractedmoments/223052548/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1668&#34; title=&#34;cash&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cash-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash or friends? Despite our assertion that the latter is more important, our behavior often suggests that we value money more than our relationships. We tend to work ourselves to death, and if there is any time left over, we think about seeing our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best friend is returning home from a year working in West Virginia, in a town that is 3 hours from the nearest interstate, in some of the most beautiful country I’ve ever seen. When he left to go work there, I drove down with him, and now that he is coming back, I’ve offered to drive down to get the rest of his stuff and help him bring it home. He has already driven half of it back, so we will be leaving together to get the rest, spending a week down there, and then driving home again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I explained to some friends that I would be out of town next week, and why, they seemed surprised that I would go to so much trouble just to provide my friend with company on his long drive back and forth.</description>

      <title>Freedom-Promoting Jobs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; caption=&#34;Candlemaker on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/5/8016593_21260c4b3f.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; &#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/8016593_21260c4b3f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a repost of an article I wrote for another blog on career advice for young people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just have to do your own thing, no matter what anyone says. It&#39;s your life.” &lt;em&gt;- Ethan Embry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons out there why you would want to avoid a job like the plague. After all, there is a reason Robert Kiyosaki, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.wordpress.com/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, refers to the dreaded word as a mere acronym for &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;ust &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;ver &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;roke. Nevertheless, getting a job is the easiest way there is to make money, if not necessarily the most desirable, and as such is an invaluable method for providing the necessary foundation to jump off to freedom. Let’s be ridiculous and say we want a job with few hours, lots of freedom, and plenty of money. Where on earth do you find one like that? Before we go on, let me define what exactly I mean when I say Job.</description>
