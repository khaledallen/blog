      <description>A break from the usual thought-provoking stuff to share something I&#39;m getting really passionate about: Movement Naturale! This was the original functional fitness program developed by the French before WWI. I read about it years ago, and it was what initially sparked my interest in other functional fitness programs like CrossFit. Partly because it was so intense, I didn&#39;t really entertain the notion of getting into it right off the bat, but now that I&#39;ve developed a good base from CrossFit and have started trail running, I&#39;m probably going to start incorporating some of it into my fitness program.</description>
