      <title>The Foundation of Empowered Living</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first task of the aspiring hero is to train her body. Only when she has learned how to master the external world can she begin the far more difficult task of mastering the internal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;The Entrepreneurial Benefits of Healthy Living&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-entrepreneurial-benefits-of-healthy-living/&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve talked before about how success-oriented types tend to discount the importance of health&lt;/a&gt;. We tell ourselves that we need to put in as much work as we can, now, when we&#39;re young and resilient. Once we&#39;ve earned our leisure time, we will make up for all the lost sleep, convenient food, drinking, and hours spent hunched in front of a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We tend to ignore just how much this neglect is impacting our ability to do quality work right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to talk about the importance of fitness in particular, and why a &lt;strong&gt;physical practice&lt;/strong&gt; is so essential to mastering yourself and unleashing your true potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training my body, becoming stronger and more coordinated, has had a huge impact on my sense of &lt;a title=&#34;How Moving Well Can Make You Confident and Popular&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/two-reasons-play-is-a-big-deal/&#34;&gt;self-confidence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;Practicing Courage Through Movement&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/practicing-courage-throught-movement/&#34;&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe it is an essential thing for any aspiring Warrior to find peace with his or her body. Your body is not just who you are, but it is also your mode of expression in the world. Learn to cultivate it, to appreciate it, and to &lt;a title=&#34;Listen to Your Intuition: It Could Save Your Life&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/listen-to-your-intuition-it-could-save-your-life/&#34;&gt;trust it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Training Ground for the Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many epics, myths, and legends, young heroes spend their early training in physical preparation. This isn&#39;t because the physical is more important than the mental and the spiritual, but because it is the most basic realm we must master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a hero expect to overcome the more challenges of ideas, thoughts, principles, motivation, and loyalty if they cannot manage their own bodies and move through the world? &lt;strong&gt;Physical competence is a foundational prerequisite for mental and spiritual competencies.</description>

      <title>Integrity of Movement, and My First RKC Class</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/integrity-of-movement-and-my-first-rkc-class/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7400969208_010890b9c21.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-2231&#34; title=&#34;Cheetah Run&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7400969208_010890b9c21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Like a graceful vase, a cat, even when motionless, seems to flow.” - George F. Will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always espoused the importance of &lt;a title=&#34;Move and Be Free&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/move-and-be-free/&#34;&gt;good quality movement&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn&#39;t until I attended my first RKC Kettlebell class that I got to experience how Integrity of Movement can be taught and conveyed through a comprehensive program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RKC class, which stands for Russian Kettlebell Certification, was taught completely in Korean (because I live in Korea right now), but that wasn&#39;t a huge problem because the coaches were so well-versed in observing and correcting body-mechanics. They had a huge arsenal of tactile cues and could spot an anterior-tilted pelvis across the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute class focused on just one movement: the kettlebell swing. For those who have done it, it seems like a fairly simple movement: just swing the kettlebell, using your hips, and keep your back straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;d been teaching kettlebell swings the way I was taught at my CrossFit Level 1 cert for two years. I&#39;ve been doing them regularly for about four years. I had seen all sorts of variations, and I thought I had it down. I was very, very wrong.</description>

      <title>Move and Be Free</title>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1974&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amagill/4614314729/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-1974 &#34; title=&#34;movement&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/movement.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; AMagill on Flickr[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&#39;t freedom to move the most fundamental freedom there is? - Erwan Le Corre, founder MovNat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that walking tires you out quickly. You cannot walk more than five minutes before desperately needing a rest. Add to that the fact that you are too weak to carry a day&#39;s worth of food more than five minutes. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re also too inflexible to sit comfortably on the ground for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now try to imagine all the places you cannot go: anywhere without cars, regular and cheap food, or chairs. You are strongly dependent on the presence and goodwill of other people for things as simple as your comfort. Because of your inability to move your body and endure hardship, you have fewer options for where you can go and the things you can do. You literally could not go more than five minutes without needing someone or something to help you. If you get stuck or behind schedule, you&#39;re screwed because you cannot run to catch a bus, much less a few miles to the nearest gas station if your car breaks down out of cell phone range on an urgent errand. You are dependent, in a very visceral sense.</description>
