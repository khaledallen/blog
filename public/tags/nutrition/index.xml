      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2035&#34; title=&#34;Slow Food Snail&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2971889105_dc2fe2cb01.jpg-300x298.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People used to hunt for their food, or risk their lives to find and gather it. When we settled down to farm, we still had to work hard all year to ensure we had enough. Food was needed to live, but we also paid a high price to acquire it. So, when we ate it, we respected it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how healthy I eat, I never seem to enjoy the &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt; when all I can think about is the &lt;em&gt;nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. I never realized how important it is to bring some compassion to mealtime in order to truly benefit from eating. This attitude elevates eating from mere consumption for the sake of maintenance, to true Nourishment, that gives us the energy to rise above life’s challenges, instead of simply enduring them.</description>

      <title>The Enemy of the Good</title>

&lt;p&gt;In my chosen fitness niche, there is a tendency to only focus on what gets results and ignore the rest. CrossFitters tend to scoff at bodybuilders and pro football players alike. The belief is that these individuals are wasting their time as far as fitness is concerned because they are too specialized and not lined up for optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, strict adherents of the Paleo diet tend to dismiss those who only follow it partially. Anyone who knows anything about nutrition wouldn’t go near a loaf of bread, ever! If you do, you don’t take your health seriously. You should either change your ways or give up completely. So say the perfectly fit. Go the whole 9 yards, or not at all.</description>

      <title>An Odd Duck: My Stranger Health Habits</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the name of health, I engage in some practices that others find pretty weird. I actually don&#39;t find them that odd, and they aren&#39;t really inconvenient to me. I actually really enjoy them. But since they aren&#39;t mainstream, they garner some odd looks. I thought I&#39;d list some of them for your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little rebellion now and then... is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.”- Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/healthy-living-join-the-health-_b_799191.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;claiming that being healthy is a revolutionary act, a difficult process that necessitates you make choices that put you in opposition to the mainstream and the social norm. To be healthy requires you be willing to ostracise yourself in the name of your own well-being because the sad truth is that our society has made poor health the trend and the norm.</description>

      <title>E-book Review: A Simple Guide to Eating Well</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/e-book-review-a-simple-guide-to-eating-well/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/simpleguide.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1209&#34; title=&#34;simpleguide&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/simpleguide-237x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;237&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a review of an e-book by a fellow blogger that I&#39;ve followed for years. His blog, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://zentofitness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zen to Fitness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; is inspired by the idea that health and vitality should not be a struggle. I am not an affiliate marketer for his book; this review is simply me sharing insights on an interesting book I read by a blogger who has inspired my own fitness pursuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a great deal of time learning about and exploring many different kinds of diets, I’ve come across a lot of overly complicated explanations of how to eat healthy. Everyone seems to think their way is best, but I’ve found that the basic principles of diets that actually work are always the same: eat meals balanced in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, made from fresh, high quality ingredients. Avoid too much sugar, and enjoy your food, eating when you’re hungry until you’re full. Whether it’s Paleo, Primal, Zone, Locavore, Vegtarian, Vegan, or Traditional, these principles always seem to hold. Of course, exponents of each diet focus on what makes them different, and this just leads to confusion. Vegans will tell you that eating meat leads to bodily decay, while the Paleo crowd will tell you that not eating meat leads to decrepitude.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Fitness Truths</title>

&lt;p&gt;“A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise.” -Winnie the Pooh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I began CrossFit two years ago, I&#39;ve learned some things about fitness that seem very counterintuitive. When I started training other people, one of my biggest challenges had been convincing people that what they&#39;ve always thought about fitness is wrong. Here are some common misconceptions that I&#39;ve discovered to be false, along with some strange truths that you wouldn&#39;t suspect.</description>

      <title>5 Simple Ways to Be Healthier</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.onrender.com/archive/simple-ways-to-be-healthier/</link>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea is drunk to forget the din of the world. -T’ien Yiheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time finding ways to be healthier without dedicating huge chunks of time or money that I don&#39;t have. While a lot of the success I&#39;ve come across has been the result of some pretty big changes, I have found that the most basic and important things come from small changes. Increased energy levels, better sleep, better digestion, feeling calmer and more relaxed, less pain, and better relationships have all been the result of the smaller, cheaper alternations I&#39;ve made to my life. When these things fall off, problems occur. Here are some really small changes you can make to improve your life in noticeable ways.</description>

      <title>My Paleo Journey</title>

A number of my fellow CrossFitters didn&#39;t make it all the way though. The same attitude that gets them through grueling workouts is now making them very frustrated with themselves and their perceived inability to stick to a simple diet plan. They can&#39;t understand why a slice of toast is more difficult to overcome than a 250lb barbell.</description>
