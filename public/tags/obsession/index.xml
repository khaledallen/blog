      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered how great things get accomplished in this world. It&#39;s so hard to get past the day-to-day of basic social niceties, the need to make a living, following current fashion trends, and doing what&#39;s expected of you. How does anyone have time to do anything else? Where do you find the time to redefine a field when most modern fields require all your time just to stay current? How do you become all that you can be when being the bare minimum is a full time job?</description>
