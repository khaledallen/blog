&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you&#39;ve got to let everything go - purge yourself. If you are unhappy with anything . . . whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you&#39;ll find that when you&#39;re free, your true creativity, your true self comes out.” - Tina Turner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity! The word rings of freedom, personal fulfillment, making a difference. It is how we contribute to the world around us and &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; new realities out of our ideas. Most of us were very creative when we were young. When I was younger, I was immensely creative. I would write short stories daily. I was constantly drawing things on my school papers, and I filled up several sketchbooks. I even wrote poetry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought that my creativity was the result of a messy, hectic life, but my life got a lot messier in college, right about the time my creativity disappeared.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There have often been times in my life when things seemed largely out of control. Everything seemed to be just out of my grasp. There was too much on my plate, I wasn&#39;t doing the things I wanted to, I wasn&#39;t moving my life in the direction I wanted to go. Basically, everything was going haywire. At those times, I have always found myself with two possible responses.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Smile, breathe, and go slowly &lt;em&gt;- Thich Nhat Hanh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in college, drowning under the immense workload and the complexities of balancing my social life, personal life, and scholastic commitments, I stumbled upon a blog that saved my academic standing as well as my sanity. The blog is called Zen Habits, and it was a godsend.</description>
