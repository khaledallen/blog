&lt;p&gt;This morning while I was practicing Karate by a forest stream (yeah, I do things like that), a duck hen floated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped to watch her go and was struck by how at-home she seemed. If I blocked out the houses at the top of the hill, I could imagine we were out in the untamed wilderness. She didn&#39;t seem bothered by the fact that there were houses and cars and roads just over the hill, nor by the fact that there was a human by her stream. She was a duck, in the river, in the forest, just as things should be.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Man&#39;s heart away from nature becomes hard.  &lt;em&gt;-Standing Bear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural world is all around us. Every city is merely an island of human habitation amidst a vast sea of countryside and forests. A mere hour outside of New York, one of the biggest metropolises in the world, one can find beautiful and surprisingly isolated parks and hiking trails. The hills around LA are still pretty wild (apparently coyotes are a major concern out there). Most cities have parks, little spaces where the city&#39;s fabric is cut out to reveal the nature underneath, just waiting to burst through into sunlight. These are places people can go to escape the hustle of the city for a while. There is something calming and serene about nature. I always feel complete and more balanced when surrounded by trees, and there is a lot to be said for seeking out a regular connection with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
