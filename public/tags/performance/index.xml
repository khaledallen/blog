      <description>I came across a study recently looking at the relationship between stress and health. The study uncovered a relationship between high levels of stress and premature death, but only when those suffering the high stress also believed that stress was bad for them.
What I thought interesting is that the group that didn&#39;t believe stress was negative still experienced the same amount of stress. They just didn&#39;t die from it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise program, CrossFit demands that its participants expose themselves to a wide variety of different challenges; you learn very quickly what you&#39;re good at and what you&#39;re not. Often, one weakness can derail an entire workout as you struggle to make up the slack.</description>
