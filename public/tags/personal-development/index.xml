      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay...I&#39;ve really got it this time. Seriously. &lt;strong&gt;I now know what this blog is about&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I&#39;ve said that a lot before, but this time it&#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. See that snazzy new subtitle. This blog isn&#39;t about me anymore (well, I guess it will always kind of be about me). It&#39;s about &lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;, trying to make ourselves the best we can be, so that we can be the most awesome, helpful, revolutionary, world-changing people we can.</description>

      <title>How To Best Use Your Teacher</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1400&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;286&#34; caption=&#34;velvettangerine on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/velvettangerine/3922005142/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1400&#34; title=&#34;teacher&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/teacher-286x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;286&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re trying to learn something or achieve a skill, a teacher can be a big help, since they have already done what you want to do. But there are some pitfalls to having a teacher, especially if you try to put all the responsibility for your progress on their shoulders. The best way to use a teacher is as a resource for your own learning, not as the basis or sole motivation for your goals.&lt;em&gt; (if you&#39;re short on time, you can skip to the end of the article for a summary, a policy I&#39;ll be using more regularly)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trainer, I work with a lot of people who want to get in great shape, but don&#39;t really want to put in the effort. Sure, they do the exercises I recommend when they show up, and they push themselves pretty hard. But then I won&#39;t see them for weeks. They have lessons maybe once a month, very intermittently, and as a result, they don&#39;t move towards their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have trainees who see me about that often, but who do make progress. The difference is in the way they view our relationship. To the first group, I am responsible for their fitness progress. &lt;strong&gt;To the second group, I am merely a resource for them as they make their own journey towards fitness&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why jump off the bridge just because everyone else is doing it? You can step back from the bridge, turn around, and walk away into new adventures that had previously been only fleeting ideas. You can also help other people walk away from the bridge, or you can rewrite the rules the brought to the bridge in the first place. The possibilities are unlimited, but it all begins with the deliberate decision to think differently - Chris Guillebeau., &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I did a book review, as I&#39;ve been reading several books at once. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve finally managed to finish one, by fellow blogger and inspiration Chris Guillebeau of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;. Chris is a self-described traveler and writer. He pays the bills by writing (which he can do from anywhere), and spends as much time as possible travelling the world with the ultimate goal of visiting every country. His book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity,&lt;/em&gt; provides readers with a glimpse of his unorthodox worldviews which, he maintains, are much more empowering and liberating than the traditional worldview we are taught to follow.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The 80/20 Principle&lt;/a&gt;, I undertook some exercises recommended by the author to identify my &#39;happiness islands&#39; and my &#39;achievement islands&#39;, times in my life when I was especially happy or productive. The pattern that emerged was that I have been especially productive when I&#39;m either working for myself or have the freedom to set my own agenda and goals. My happiness is also strongly correlated with my independence.</description>

      <title>What is Warrior Spirit?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/what-is-warrior-spirit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1215&#34; title=&#34;Warrior Spirit&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/TShirtBack-300x240.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrior stands defiant, spear in hand, looking over a vast plain. Below him is a world full of challenge and adversity, dangerous enemies and tempting shortcuts. Beyond is a great mountain range, full of promise certainly, but hiding even greater challenges. On the other side...who knows? Hope, transcendence, enlightenment. Or perhaps darker, more sinister rewards hide behind those peaks. All the Warrior knows is that he has decided to scale them, carve a path through the plains and over the mountains, leading the way for others who seek a better life on the other side, guiding them and defending the tribe from the dangers ahead. He knows he may not survive, but he has prepared well and is among the greatest, most capable leaders of his tribe. He is confident and eager to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Serving Others in Personal Growth</title>

&lt;p&gt;“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -Napoleon Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much about the Warrior Spirit is centered around independence and self-sufficiency. I talk a lot about the need to stick to our own convictions and believe in our own dreams. There is a lot of standing up against the tide of mediocrity that tries to bring us back into the fold, a lot of fighting for our best lives and the life we want. So it may come as a bit of a shock when I say that a true Warrior is not complete if he only pursues his own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the purpose of developing the self is so that you can serve others better.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“To learn something new, take the path that you took yesterday.” - John Burroughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my last day at the CrossFit gym where I had worked for the past year as a coach and personal trainer. I decided several weeks ago to leave the gym and pursue other opportunities on my own, and I finally took the step of leaving. It was a difficult decision, not so much because of financial reasons, but more because I loved working with the amazing athletes and dedicated individuals who came to train with us. Nevertheless, I am excited to be moving forward with my plans, even though there is a great degree of apprehension regarding my financial security. I feel that sometimes we have to pull apart everything we&#39;ve built for ourselves to build something new, or backtrack the path we&#39;ve already been down to look for new turn-offs with a better idea of where we want to go this time.</description>

There is no one alive who is Youer than You.” - Dr. Seuss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the responses I got from all of you on that &lt;a href=&#34;http://polldaddy.com/s/444345CCC43313A2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey &lt;/a&gt;I sent out, most of the interest in what I write comes from knowing me. So I thought I&#39;d write out my story, so those of you who didn&#39;t know me before the blog can understand where I&#39;m coming from, where I get my stories and interpretations, and why I care so much about standing up to mediocrity and forging my own destiny.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hide not your talents. They for use were made. What is a sundial in the shade?&#34; &lt;em&gt;- Benjamin Franklin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really know what you are good at? Or are you, like most people, more aware of your failings than your strengths? And how much of your time is spent doing things you are really good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, most people (70% according to the Gallup organization) do not get to work at something they are good at. Most of their time is spent doing a job or duty which they find frustrating, difficult, or unintuitive. This costs them their sense of self-esteem, job satisfaction, and productivity, making them resent their work and perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tom Rath, author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159562015X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=warrspir-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159562015X&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=warrspir-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=159562015X&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
, this is a situation that can be remedied to the benefit of organization and individuals.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have recently learned a back handspring, and a front flip, among some other more complex gymnastics moves. Every time I want to try one without my coach to spot me, he considers whether I&#39;m ready, nods and says, &#34;Alright, give it a shot. The chance of seriously injuring yourself is probably less than 60/40.&#34; He is joking, sort of, but it is true that many of the stunts I attempt are actually quite dangerous. And that is why I don&#39;t mess up. &lt;strong&gt;Without safety nets, I can&#39;t afford to fail.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Never tell your problems to anyone...20% don&#39;t care and the other 80% are glad you have them..&#34; &lt;em&gt;- Lou Holtz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most frustrating aspects of life is that whenever you become passionate about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/dont-be-afraid-to-reach-for-your-goals/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;pursuing some extraordinary goal&lt;/a&gt; or lifestyle, people waste no time in trying to hold you back. I find it odd that people rarely go out of their way to encourage your ambitions, but they will eagerly jump into a conversation to provide reasons you are wrong, might fail, or wasting your time. Especially if they have to change some aspect of their lives to accommodate you, they will do their utmost to convince you that your desire to run off and contribute to world peace will absolutely end their livliehoods.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.” - General Norman Schwarzkopf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is largely about the development of character. The most important quality of character is integrity, because without it, character has no meaning. So what is integrity, anyway? The word is vaguely defined in most discussions, and looking back over my posts, I realize I have never actually clarified what it is I am talking about.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m qualified to define a morality for all young people, or even why I care so much. I figure it&#39;s as much for myself as for others. I don&#39;t know why it gets harder to achieve your potential after childhood, how to balance pragmatism and idealism, when high standards bleed into obsessive perfectionism. I don&#39;t know if anything I say applies to girls, or why more girls comment on what I write even though the image of a warrior is masculine to me.</description>

      <title>Integrity: There is more to Life than Winning...There&#39;s being Awesome!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/handstand.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-493&#34; title=&#34;handstand&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/handstand.jpg?w=199&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Since the CrossFit sectionals I&#39;ve been feeling considerably less motivated about my training. You&#39;d think that making it to regionals would give me a message that I have some potential, and that I should work hard to realize it. Instead, I feel oppressed by the prospect of competing again. All my training is geared towards this one event, an event that has a very narrow definition of success (even by the standards of CrossFit), and in which I will undoubtedly be one of the smallest, puniest, guys there. Maybe I&#39;m over-dramatizing here, but I definitely feel like an underdog - I&#39;m young, relatively weak (most guys at these things can deadlift 400+ lbs, I&#39;m around 315lb on a good day), and pretty inexperienced. If it&#39;s all about who can move the most weight, I&#39;m screwed.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Persistence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/penguin.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-489&#34; title=&#34;penguin&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/penguin.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;222&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, the workout at my gym was to determine at what weight you could do 10 non-stop power cleans (move a barbell from floor to shoulder in one motion). At 165lbs, my form began to slip and I dragged the knurled bar up my shins, several times, leaving my legs bloody and stinging. I failed the set, only getting 9. Pretty upset with myself, I went to the bathroom to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was taping up my leg, I was thinking about calling it a day. But looking at my leg, I realized there wasn&#39;t any actual damage. All I&#39;d done was scrape some skin, and while it stung, it had no impact on my muscles&#39; ability to perform. I covered the wound in tape to protect it, and got back on the pad, and did the full set as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of times in our lives when we suffer dramatic and painful failures. Our usual response is to throw in the towel, grudgingly accept that we did our best, and nurse our wounded egos. But when we look back, it is clear that our egos were the only things that were really injured by our setback. Our ability to complete the task at hand has not been diminished in any way, we simply have decided, arbitrarily, that we have failed.</description>

      <title>Mental Toughness, and the CrossFit Northeast Sectionals</title>

      <description>I just got back from two days of the most intense physical and mental challenges of my life, the CrossFit Northeast Sectionals, the first step on the road to the 2010 CrossFit games, the winners of which are considered the fittest man and woman on Earth.
I&#39;m too tired right now to write a detailed play-by-play, so right now, I just want to share some thoughts.
I was certainly one of the smaller guys going into this competition, and I have only been CrossFitting for a little over a year.</description>

The other Stamford-based CrossFit gym, Hybrid Fitness, believes that extreme strength is pretty much the fundamental requirement for a good athelete. As such, they utilize a lot of strongman programming and training. We do not, and generally we aren&#39;t as strong on average. Does that mean we are worse than them?</description>

The author undertook to learn the ways of pickup artists for a year, ended up becoming one of the greatest pickup artists in the world (according to an internal rating), developed his own system, and eventually stepped out. He then wrote a book about his experiences, triggering a massive outpouring of additional pickup methods, books, how-to&#39;s, workshops, dating coaching seminars, etc.</description>

An old friend sent me a link to a really profound article yesterday. The article is an interview with a Pueblo-turned-Mayan-shaman, Martin Prechtel. In the interview Prechtel discusses his relationship with the spiritual world of indigenous cultures that have a respect for, and connection to, the land and environment around them. He also draws some really ominous connections between the utter lack - some would say, outright denial - of spirituality in Western civilization and the cultural malaise we experience in the form of endemic depression, poverty, loneliness, and even physical ailment.</description>

So here are a few partially inconvenient truths I&#39;ve managed to internalize over the past few years.</description>

      <title>The Ties That Bind</title>

&lt;p&gt;In my path down alternative fitness and nutrition and spirituality, I&#39;m discovering that members of my various communities all seem to agree on certain things. Most CrossFitters tend to agree that we should move as our bodies were meant to, and often think in terms of evolutionary biology and anatomy. This parallels a similar trend in the local and traditional food community to look back to how our ancestors ate to determine the best way to eat now. In fact, the CrossFitters also extend this mentality to nutrition, and I&#39;m sure many traditional foodies would as well if fitness were as central to their lives as nutrition is to a CrossFitter&#39;s.</description>

A number of my fellow CrossFitters didn&#39;t make it all the way though. The same attitude that gets them through grueling workouts is now making them very frustrated with themselves and their perceived inability to stick to a simple diet plan. They can&#39;t understand why a slice of toast is more difficult to overcome than a 250lb barbell.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Service</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/traits-of-a-warrior-service/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, Warriors have been the guardians of their societies. They do not train and fight for the sake of it, or for senseless violence. Historical warriors have learned the arts of war in order to better protect their people and families, or to extend their reach of their chosen sovereign. Tribal warriors were the ones who put their lives on the line to defend their families. Knights and Samurai were the ones willing to die for their lords&#39; agenda.</description>
