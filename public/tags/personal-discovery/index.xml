&lt;p&gt;When you are content to be simply yourself and don&#39;t compare or compete, everyone will respect you. -Lao Tsu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why it is so hard to be myself, but it seems to be the biggest challenge I have faced in life. From what I read of others’ journeys, it is a universal struggle. Not only is it difficult, it is fraught with dead ends, false trails, and misleading half-truths. For many of us, we don’t even realize we are not being ourselves. We think we are acting spontaneously and expressing a creative individuality, but in fact we are mimicking some idea of individuality or are simply repeating old habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to ‘be yourself?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think ‘being yourself’ is the kind of thing you can talk about directly. It is the subject of Buddhist meditation, the mystic’s search for communion with the divine, and an entire literature of spiritual, scientific, and cultural studies. So, to explain what I think it means to ‘be yourself’ I will resort to an example.</description>
