&lt;p&gt;&#34;We cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.&#34;Â - Florence Scovel Shinn Artist, Teacher and Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words we use to convey our thoughts and describe our lives influence the way we see the world to a greater extent than most of us realize. It may not seem like a big difference, but choosing to use one word or descriptor over another can help you overcome negative or constraining worldviews. Think about how you talk about your goals. Do you refer to them as dreams or as concrete objectives? Do you talk to yourself in the first or second person? Do you refer to other people using condescending terms (&#39;girls&#39; for all women)? Such subtle changes in the language you use will, over time, change the way you think about people and how others deal with you.</description>
