      <description>Alright! It&#39;s the end of the second week in January and we&#39;re finally done with all the ways to plan out an epic 2015. Part 1 focused on the big picture strategy. Part 2 focused on the foundational habits that need to happen to provide the time, energy, and financial resources to make it happen. Part 3 will focus on the specific actions to take.
For the underlying theory, go here.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I wake up earlier than I want to, and work longer than I want do, at a job that wasn’t my idea, creating something that was never on my radar for things I want to accomplish in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do I do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably to get paid so that I can live, but walking through the snow yesterday to the school where I work, I couldn’t help but wonder what the point of making enough money to live was. What would I do with the living that I earned? Just make more living, more money, so that I could go on buying food and renting a roof over my head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt the need to rise above the clouds of my day-to-day for a little bit, to get a wider perspective on my life and why I do what I do.</description>
