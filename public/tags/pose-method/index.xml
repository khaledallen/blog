&lt;p&gt;Running is probably the most basic of human movements, besides walking. As an exercise, its benefits and usefulness are unparalleled. If I had to give up all but one mode of exercise, the one I&#39;d keep would be running in all its glorious manifestations: contemplative jogs, serene trail runs, tense hustles, heart-about-to-explode sprints. It is my favorite physical activity involving clothes (most of the time). Because it is so closely related to walking, we take to it pretty naturally. Nobody has to learn how to run in the way we learn how to swim or bike. You simply put one foot in front of the other, faster and faster and faster.</description>
