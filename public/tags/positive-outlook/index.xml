&lt;p&gt;Is your intention everyday just to survive? Is your intention everyday just to make it through the world, because your interpretation is &#39;the world is so hard, so stressful, so chaotic, I hope I can just get through this day&#39;? Because if that&#39;s where you&#39;re at, that identity for you is small. - Brendon Burchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to whine...a lot. Practically every word out of my mouth was a complaint of some kind. I was either talking about my frustration over my homework load, kvetching over the constant barrage of e-mails, or just going on about random aches and pains and fatigue. The only information I had to share with anyone was about how something was bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hardly conscious of my behavior; whining just seemed to be the natural thing to say, and after all, it seemed to me that most conversations were based around complaining. People would get together after work to basically whine about the difficult week. Guys would bond over complaining about their girlfriends, and women would commiserate over the poor quality of men in their lives. Most of the student conversations I heard were about academic frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was not pleasant to be around, and my family made this very clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t want to be that guy nobody invites to parties (I was already that guy, and knew it wasn&#39;t fun). I didn&#39;t want to be the guy nobody could rely on who couldn&#39;t handle his own life. So I resolved to change what I thought was a seemingly simple habit of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how deep it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rule I instituted was: if what I am about to say is something negative and simply expresses how I feel bad about something, with no suggestion of actually fixing the problem, I will keep my mouth shut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only moderate self-control, I did very well at this. It was merely a matter of keeping my lips sealed. Sometimes I found I had nothing to contribute to conversations, but at least I wasn&#39;t bringing people down anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I made a horrifying discovery.</description>
