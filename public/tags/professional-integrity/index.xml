Such is the case with job offers. I was recently offered a position at Forbes, where I have been helping out on the social media team in exchange for experience. I very much appreciated the offer, and my first instinct was to immediately accept. But I had made other commitments that I didn&#39;t feel entirely comfortable walking away from on such short notice. So I declined the offer. I&#39;ve gotten reactions ranging from disbelief, to surprise, to admiration, to declarations of my stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
