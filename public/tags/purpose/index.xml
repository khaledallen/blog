      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3907&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/watch-e1421889550877.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;watch&#34; width=&#34;698&#34; height=&#34;210&#34; /&gt;Imagine what your life would be like and what you&#39;d accomplish if you started &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; day full of passion, purpose and drive. Not just a few days a month, or a few hours of each day, but every hour of every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re probably thinking that&#39;d be great, but it&#39;s not realistic. After all, moods and mindsets are fickle, and people are either born with drive or they&#39;re not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself asking the same question recently, and I decided to see if I could find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my research on high achieving individuals, from the ultra-wealthy to the ultra-accomplished, I noticed that the biggest difference was their mindset. They ask different kinds of questions and see the world in a different way than the majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For an example of this, check out &lt;a title=&#34;KhanAcademy Interviews Elon Musk&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDwzmJpI4io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sal Khan&#39;s interview of Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me that an essential technique for increasing people&#39;s capabilities was to find a way for them to consistently elevate their mindset. Each day spent in a state of openness to possibility compounds on the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, for most of us, our mindset is determined by our mood, which is often determined by the events of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to make sure that every day started with an empowered mindset.</description>

      <title>The Things That Matter</title>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-things-that-matter/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1/&#34; rel=&#34;attachment wp-att-2674&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-2674&#34; title=&#34;A moment of pure bliss&#34; alt=&#34;Two dogs and a glass of wine&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/737679_940187808960_3223248_o1-1024x576.jpg&#34; width=&#34;574&#34; height=&#34;322&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started as a way to live responsibly. Knowing all the suffering and pollution caused by industrial farming and how that impacted my health, I made the commitment to eating organic and supporting local food whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify my decision-making, I made up all sorts of rules about what I could and couldn&#39;t eat. Soon, adhering to the rules became more important than what the rules were meant to help me accomplish, which was eating in harmony. This harmonious way of eating would naturally give rise to health, but when I ran into the Paleo and Primal communities, health itself took the top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the obsession over good vs. bad carbs, optimal post-workout nutrition, and coconut substitutions for everything, I realized my diet had become meaningless. By all accounts, I ate well. My food was high quality and nutritious, but all this was lost on me. &lt;strong&gt;I didn&#39;t even taste my meals anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&#39;t know how common this is among Paleo eaters and I hope you will leave comments sharing your experiences. It seems to me that obsessing over the health aspects of Paleo (dangerously easy to do given the mindset of the community) could lead us to forget how to enjoy our food for its own sake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventually, I came to believe that &lt;a title=&#34;You Can’t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-cant-afford-to-be-attached-to-your-health-so-make-it-about-others/&#34;&gt;my health doesn&#39;t matter&lt;/a&gt;, per se. I didn&#39;t live to be healthy. I was healthy in order to live well. &lt;/strong&gt;How I ate needed to be a reflection of that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. That is clear.&#34; - His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I realized that, I stopped getting so upset with the dietary rules. Eventually, I was able to reconnect with the enjoyment of my food again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, as you get deeper into Paleo, you realize that optimal health requires eating and living sustainably. So, even if your main priority is health, you are forced to aim higher, to prioritize something more general, in order to achieve that. The reality forces a widening of your concerns. If you refuse to see this, you end up chasing your own tail in a never-ended spiral of healthy living.</description>
