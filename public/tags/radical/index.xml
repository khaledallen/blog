      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sunflower.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright  wp-image-3114&#34; alt=&#34;sunflower&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sunflower.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Being in good shape puts you at odds with a lot of society. It denies--or at least minimizes--the value of some of our culture&#39;s greatest accomplishments: abundant food, two cars in every driveway, accessible technology, drugs for every ailment. It&#39;s generally poor form to question or refuse these blessings of civilization. It angers the other sheep when you start asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, our society is not structured to help individuals achieve their greatest potential in health. We&#39;ve done a very good job of eliminating the stressors that temper our bodies, with the result that our daily lives do not provide the stimulus we need to stay in our best shape. &lt;strong&gt;Now, if we want to develop our bodies, we have to go out of our way to do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be healthy, we need to take time out of our life in order to perform extensive and inconvenient maintenance (unless you&#39;re one of those people who &lt;em&gt;actually enjoys&lt;/em&gt; being active, then maybe you take time out of your life for your job). The alternative is to simply accept what most of the American population does: that chronic disease is inevitable, that the ability to lift and carry more than you weigh is impossible, that hoisting yourself over an object by your own strength is beyond human capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the norm, we have to eat differently, act differently, move differently, sleep differently. To a certain extent, we have to purposefully ostracize ourselves, choose certain friends that can support our habit, and stick out. Other&#39;s may respect and even envy health, but that doesn&#39;t make it any easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lifestyle sounds a lot like the one followed by many game-changers and amazingly successful people. From what I&#39;ve read and researched, starting a successful business that makes a difference requires you to live by a different set of rules. You do things and believe in possibilities that other people don&#39;t even consider. You question the status quo about money or the kind of influence you can have. You certainly don&#39;t play by the standard rules of go-to-school-get-good-grades-get-a-safe-job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So essentially, to break out of the status quo in anything, whether it&#39;s health, wealth, influence, or comedy, you have to be a radical&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>
