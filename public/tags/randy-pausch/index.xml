&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little kid, I’ve had a powerful sense of the imminence of my own death. Not that I expected to die in the near future, but I was always painfully aware that one day would be my last, and eventually, I would cease to experience anything ever again. I would get panic attacks mulling over the reality of my mortality. For a 9 year-old kid, that’s pretty heavy stuff. I still sometimes catch my mind wandering over to the other side, and as a result, my whole life I’ve carried with me an urgency to make the most of my time. I don’t know whether this is common or not, but I’m just acutely aware that one day, there will be no more me.&lt;br /&gt;
