&lt;p&gt;“It is the observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, societies have always gone through cycles of establishment and revolution. The established order, originally meant as liberating, starts to become oppressive in its attempts to institutionalize itself. In turn, revolutionaries rise to oppose the system, to assert individuality and reinstate the balance. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they are incorporated into the existing order, and sometimes they overthrow the current order and establish their own system. We are at a time of revolution, though it is a quiet one.</description>
