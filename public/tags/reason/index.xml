      <description>I recently completed the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert M. Pirsig, which, contrary to its name, is not a book about Zen or motorcycle maintenance, except in a very roundabout way.
The book is set in the motorcycle roadtrip of a father, the narrator, and his son, Chris, but the real meat of the book is contained in a series of chataquas, or talks, investigating a philosophical conundrum central to Western thought.</description>

      <title>Was Going to College a Mistake?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in the midst of reading &lt;em&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance &lt;/em&gt;by Robert M. Pirsig&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and the author spends a lot of time talking about the educational system in the United States, indeed, all of Western civilization. As a recent college graduate, this is something I&#39;ve actually questioned a lot myself. I don&#39;t know about most of my peers, but I never really thought of college as a necessity, or even a forgone conclusion. When I applied to college, I did it in the context of an expectation - I went to a college-prep school and was at the top of my class, everybody at that school expected me to go to college - but I personally did not necessarily want to go to college. I chose to go, consciously, because I was convinced that it would help me achieve my goals. I did, however, entertain other options.</description>
