&lt;p&gt;“Every human being has hundreds of separate people living under his skin. The talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living with him.” - Mel Brooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was standing on the train platform on my way into New York when a young girl standing with her mother looked over and asked me, &#34;Are you a writer?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been asked this before. Normally, if people see me carrying my journal, they ask if I write, but not if I am myself a &#39;writer&#39;. But this girl thought I looked like a writer, with my long hair, unshaven beard, and worn leather jacket. Or maybe it was the classically creative look of my Moleskine journal (thank you Moleskine, I will never make fun of your pretentiousness again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question left me speechless for a moment. I was almost suspicious, as if the girl had asked me, &#34;Would you like an extra $500?&#34; The first thing you want is to say yes, but it just seems too easy.</description>
