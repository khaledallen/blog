&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&#39;ve been able to commit myself to a more minimalist approach to training. As an multi-sport athlete, I&#39;ve always found it difficult to focus my training on one or two things. Instead, I&#39;ve found myself always jumping around, never giving enough time to any particular method to make much headway. Alternatively, I&#39;ve toyed with trying to do everything all the time, and quickly burned myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, by limiting the time I can train, I am finding myself more motivated to give a good effort in the less time that I do train. &lt;strong&gt;When there is less to do, and less time to do it in, you will push yourself to make the most of what time you do have&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>
