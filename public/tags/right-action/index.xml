&lt;p&gt;They say kids these days seem to have a sense of entitlement. Since ‘they’ were referring to ‘kids’ my age (aka, me) I tended to disagree with this statement. Apparently a lot of kids my age are turning down low-level service oriented jobs because we think we are above that sort of work. I tell myself I am endowed with good old fashioned values, can exercise self-discipline, and am not afraid to get my hands dirty. I can do menial tasks well and cheerfully, glad at the opportunity to be a part of something, even if just a small part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, I LOVE helping other people! I live to serve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my dad asked me to help him take the car in for service.</description>
