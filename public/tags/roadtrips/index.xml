&lt;p&gt;In my path down alternative fitness and nutrition and spirituality, I&#39;m discovering that members of my various communities all seem to agree on certain things. Most CrossFitters tend to agree that we should move as our bodies were meant to, and often think in terms of evolutionary biology and anatomy. This parallels a similar trend in the local and traditional food community to look back to how our ancestors ate to determine the best way to eat now. In fact, the CrossFitters also extend this mentality to nutrition, and I&#39;m sure many traditional foodies would as well if fitness were as central to their lives as nutrition is to a CrossFitter&#39;s.</description>
