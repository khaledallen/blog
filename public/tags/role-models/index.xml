When I was in elementary school, I was emulating my idea of what responsible adults acted like, rather than trying to grow up to be like the high school kids. I didn&#39;t look forward to high school and college as times to party and sleep around, but instead as opportunities to start developing the skills and qualities I wanted to use as the foundation of my life as aÂ responsible, formidable man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends thought I was weird, and I thought I had made a huge mistake. I still wonder if I wouldn&#39;t have been better off just going with the flow and enjoying myself, instead of trying so hard to grow up.</description>
