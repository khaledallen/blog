&lt;p&gt;“Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.” - Carl G. Jung&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading an excerpt out of a book by Carl Jung last night, and was interested to find a concept that parallels one of the ideas in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/four-books-that-changed-my-life-this-summer/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Hero with a Thousand Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Namely, that every individual must find and undergo their own path to individual self-actualization, rather than being able to follow some generalized path. This probably explains why we can spend so much time reading how-to&#39;s and inspirational blogs and never actually get around to doing something; we are reading about someone else&#39;s hero journey, and trying to take it as the direction for our own. Jung&#39;s point was that there is no universal psychological concept that can be applied to every person&#39;s situation and specific problem, despite the modern trend to try to put everyone under a general diagnosis.</description>

      <title>What Do You Call Yourself?</title>

&lt;p&gt;“They stick you with those names, those labels -- ‘rebel’ or whatever; whatever they like to use. Because they need a label; they need a name. They need something to put the price tag on the back of.” - Johnny Depp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people ask you what you do, what do you say? What would you like to say? Most people answer with their current job: &#34;I am a personal trainer,&#34; or &#34;I sell commodities,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m a homemaker.&#34; These sorts of answers are sufficient to move the conversation along, but most people &#39;do&#39; so much more than their job. Perhaps the question is actually a poorly worded version of, &#34;What is your job?&#34; I think that is only because of habit. I don&#39;t think most people care if you answer with your job or some other activity that occupies your time. So why not give an answer that really describes what it is you do?</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Be Afraid to Reach for Your Goals</title>

&lt;p&gt;People have a lot of preconceived notions about what they deserve: what they deserve to be called, what they deserve to have, what they deserve to be paid, who they deserve to love and be loved by. We set limits on our own potential, not because we want to hold ourselves back, but rather because we think it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-we-love-the-status-quo/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;just way&lt;/a&gt;. The thought pattern might go like this: &#34;I&#39;ve only been writing regularly for a few weeks, so I don&#39;t deserve a published novel.&#34; &lt;strong&gt;Ironically, people often are afraid to reach for their goals, because they don&#39;t think they are worthy of them&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.” - Frank Herbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to follow a very strict diet, and was religious about exercising. Rain or shine, groggy or energetic, sugar cravings or not, I followed my program. Ultimately, it turned out my particular program was a little intense and led to some problems, and so I have lately abandoned it for a more intuitive approach, meaning I do things when I feel like it, meaning I often don&#39;t do what I&#39;m supposed to do. At first, this felt liberating, but I&#39;ve begun to realize that I have given up something very important by letting go of my confining routines: my freedom.</description>

&lt;div&gt;“The only Zen you find on tops of mountains is the Zen you bring there” - Robert M. Pirsig&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I have lately started reading the very inspirational &lt;em&gt;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&lt;/em&gt;, by Shunryu Suzuki. This book is a collection of essays on Zen and it is both calming and enlightening to read. One of the overriding themes is the fact that Zen is not something external or alien to us. It already exists within us, in the nature of our minds, bodies, and spirits. Enlightenment is not found in some faraway spiritual realm, or even down the road. Rather, it is right there in your grasp. It is your grasp.</description>
