      <title>Investing in Yourself</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/investing-in-yourself/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You experience a windfall and suddenly, your bank account is $1000 fatter. It&#39;s not a ton of money, but it&#39;s enough to give you some breathing room in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you pay off some of your student debt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you take a trip to India?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you buy a new dress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you &lt;a title=&#34;You May Be Illiterate&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/you-may-be-illiterate/&#34;&gt;learn how to program&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us would spend our money on things we want to fill a need or something we want to &lt;a title=&#34;How Much Do You Cost? How Much Do You Create?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/how-much-do-you-cost-how-much-do-you-create/&#34;&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what if our default mode of spending was to invest in ourselves. Instead of having money leak out of the system, keep it in a cycle to generate more and more. Find ways to convert cash into personal capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Use that money to make yourself more valuable or increase your ability to generate value.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/book-review-the-8020-principle/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;The 80/20 Principle&lt;/a&gt;, I undertook some exercises recommended by the author to identify my &#39;happiness islands&#39; and my &#39;achievement islands&#39;, times in my life when I was especially happy or productive. The pattern that emerged was that I have been especially productive when I&#39;m either working for myself or have the freedom to set my own agenda and goals. My happiness is also strongly correlated with my independence.</description>

      <title>Are You Fed Up Yet?</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.” - Pope John XXIII&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with reading about all these ways to make things happen, with making plans and taking false starts. You might recall my response to &lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;/em&gt;, in which I established a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-radical-idea/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;very doable plan&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately got sidetracked. All I got out of that experience was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/choose-your-words-carefully/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;new way to see the world&lt;/a&gt; which ought to enable me to live the life I want. It freed me from accepting the normal path and got me to thinking that I can design my own life. But from what I can see I never actually went past designing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I have to wonder why.</description>

      <title>What is Warrior Spirit?</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/what-is-warrior-spirit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1215&#34; title=&#34;Warrior Spirit&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/TShirtBack-300x240.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrior stands defiant, spear in hand, looking over a vast plain. Below him is a world full of challenge and adversity, dangerous enemies and tempting shortcuts. Beyond is a great mountain range, full of promise certainly, but hiding even greater challenges. On the other side...who knows? Hope, transcendence, enlightenment. Or perhaps darker, more sinister rewards hide behind those peaks. All the Warrior knows is that he has decided to scale them, carve a path through the plains and over the mountains, leading the way for others who seek a better life on the other side, guiding them and defending the tribe from the dangers ahead. He knows he may not survive, but he has prepared well and is among the greatest, most capable leaders of his tribe. He is confident and eager to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Serving Others in Personal Growth</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/the-importance-of-serving-others-in-personal-growth/</link>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1188&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; caption=&#34;Forest Runner on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimbaker/70750719/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1188&#34; title=&#34;A Helping Hand&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/A-Helping-Hand-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -Napoleon Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much about the Warrior Spirit is centered around independence and self-sufficiency. I talk a lot about the need to stick to our own convictions and believe in our own dreams. There is a lot of standing up against the tide of mediocrity that tries to bring us back into the fold, a lot of fighting for our best lives and the life we want. So it may come as a bit of a shock when I say that a true Warrior is not complete if he only pursues his own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the purpose of developing the self is so that you can serve others better.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Words Carefully</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/choose-your-words-carefully/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;We cannot always control our thoughts, but we can control our words, and repetition impresses the subconscious, and we are then master of the situation.&#34; - Florence Scovel Shinn Artist, Teacher and Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words we use to convey our thoughts and describe our lives influence the way we see the world to a greater extent than most of us realize. It may not seem like a big difference, but choosing to use one word or descriptor over another can help you overcome negative or constraining worldviews. Think about how you talk about your goals. Do you refer to them as dreams or as concrete objectives? Do you talk to yourself in the first or second person? Do you refer to other people using condescending terms (&#39;girls&#39; for all women)? Such subtle changes in the language you use will, over time, change the way you think about people and how others deal with you.</description>

      <title>How to Beat Procrastination</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Do it now! can affect every phase of your life. It can help you do the things you should do but don&#39;t feel like doing. It can keep you from procrastinating when an unpleasant duty faces you. But it can also help you do those things that you want to do. It helps you seize those precious moments that, if lost, may never be retrieved.” - &lt;em&gt;Napoleon Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my blog today, but I have to ask, is there something more important you have to do that you are putting off by checking in? (Or perhaps reading my blog is the most important thing you have to do today, in which case I&#39;m flattered :)). &lt;strong&gt;Procrastination, the sacred art of putting things off to the last minute, is one of the biggest productivity killers in our lives, and also one of the biggest sources of stress and anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a learned habit, one that can really mess with your sense of well-being and mental health. It cuts into all aspects of our lives, from reading, to shopping, to paying bills, to exercising. So why do we procrastinate, and how can we eliminate this habit?</description>

      <title>Why You Should Blow it All to Travel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_743&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;Source: DragonWoman on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/dragonwoman/31029572/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-743 &#34; title=&#34;china&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/china.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that travel is essential to a complete education. Traveling abroad teaches understanding of other people, cultures and communities, and these types of experiences offer young people a greater ability to be successful in today&#39;s global society. &lt;em&gt;- Michael Palmer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old friend from my days interning at Forbes gave me some interesting advice today. As a well-established manager, she would have been able to make a very good argument for starting to seriously look at a career, putting down professional roots, building up my financial profile and really setting myself up for the long, steady path to independence and security. Instead, she pretty much recommended I risk it all and travel, try to work in some other countries, because, after all at my age and in this economic climate, there isn&#39;t much to lose. &lt;strong&gt;Take the big risks while you&#39;re young&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have already talked about one aspect of the mindset associated with this post-college, recessionary jobhunt, that of having confidence in my employability. I wanted to share some recent developments in my strategies and the way I&#39;m approaching things now.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A book I have recently read, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&amp;lt;iframe src=&amp;quot;http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;t=warrspir-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;amp;asins=0762415339&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;width:120px;height:240px;&amp;quot; scrolling=&amp;quot;no&amp;quot; marginwidth=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; marginheight=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; &#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;No More Mr. Nice Guy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Dr. Robert A. Glover, adds to the growing conversation on masculinity in our society. Blogs like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://artofmanliness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Art of Manliness&lt;/a&gt;, the renewed interest in old-school shaving, the death of the metrosexual (maybe? hopefully) are all part of the movement to reclaim what it means to be a real man. Gover&#39;s book is an important contribution to that movement because it addresses one of the biggest stumbling blocks that recovering pansies have to deal with: the misperception that being a Nice Guy will get you anywhere in life.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Service</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/traits-of-a-warrior-service/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, Warriors have been the guardians of their societies. They do not train and fight for the sake of it, or for senseless violence. Historical warriors have learned the arts of war in order to better protect their people and families, or to extend their reach of their chosen sovereign. Tribal warriors were the ones who put their lives on the line to defend their families. Knights and Samurai were the ones willing to die for their lords&#39; agenda.</description>
