&lt;p&gt;“It is the character of a brave and resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his post” &lt;em&gt;- Marcus Tullius Cicero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old school no longer plays dodgeball. It is against the rules. The children are urged to forget the game. In fact, we no longer play any games with a score, for fear of engendering competition. The fear is that kids will lord it over one another, put down the losers and gloat in their victory. They will brag and tease and ostracize their peers, or will feel hurt and put down. Some parents and administrators probably worry that kids who lose at dodgeball are more likely to do something violent to vent their frustration. I think this prevents kids from developing strong character.</description>
