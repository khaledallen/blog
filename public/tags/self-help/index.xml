&lt;p&gt;Why jump off the bridge just because everyone else is doing it? You can step back from the bridge, turn around, and walk away into new adventures that had previously been only fleeting ideas. You can also help other people walk away from the bridge, or you can rewrite the rules the brought to the bridge in the first place. The possibilities are unlimited, but it all begins with the deliberate decision to think differently - Chris Guillebeau., &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I did a book review, as I&#39;ve been reading several books at once. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve finally managed to finish one, by fellow blogger and inspiration Chris Guillebeau of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;. Chris is a self-described traveler and writer. He pays the bills by writing (which he can do from anywhere), and spends as much time as possible travelling the world with the ultimate goal of visiting every country. His book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity,&lt;/em&gt; provides readers with a glimpse of his unorthodox worldviews which, he maintains, are much more empowering and liberating than the traditional worldview we are taught to follow.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.” - Pope John XXIII&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fed up with reading about all these ways to make things happen, with making plans and taking false starts. You might recall my response to &lt;em&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;/em&gt;, in which I established a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/a-radical-idea/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;very doable plan&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately got sidetracked. All I got out of that experience was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/choose-your-words-carefully/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;new way to see the world&lt;/a&gt; which ought to enable me to live the life I want. It freed me from accepting the normal path and got me to thinking that I can design my own life. But from what I can see I never actually went past designing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I have to wonder why.</description>
