      <description>The problem with charging people for a service is that it limits who is worthy of being helped.
I&#39;ve been in the position of being someone who is really passionate about learning a skill, and would make the perfect student, but who cannot afford something. It never felt fair because it suggests that only rich people can be skilled or learned or whatever.
If I believe that people will benefit from learning how to be more in-tune with their bodies, to move with power and grace, then presumably this applies to all people.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2834&#34; alt=&#34;The Chief&#39;s Headdress&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/4822540384_173d27437c.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once was a tribe of people living in an ancient land. They chose from among their number one to lead them, a chief, who was the most skilled in hunting, diplomacy, and wisdom. He or she was to be a beacon for the tribe, a person to inspire a sense of belonging and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, as the current chief was dying, there were two candidates to replace her. Both boys were truly skilled in the art of warriorship, and both possessed wisdom beyond their years. They were of the same age, at the cusp of manhood, but one still acted like a little boy. He felt like someone or something had to give him permission to be a man. The other acted as if manhood were already his. He took an air of fatherhood around the children and acted like an equal among the elders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the tribe still had trouble deciding, for both boys were exceptionally skilled and passed all the tests of intellect and insight. After a long day being interviewed, the two of them found themselves alone in the chief&#39;s room, the elders having retired to discuss. Sitting in the back of the room were the chieftain&#39;s robes and headdress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As boys are wont to do, they grew curious about that which is forbidden them, and finally they decided try on these magical garments. They had been fashioned for an adult, and clearly would fit neither boy, but they wanted to feel what it would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first boy threw the robe around his scrawny shoulders and lowered the headdress over his brow. His friend only barely managed to stifle a laugh, and truly the boy in the robes felt strange and uncomfortable. He hunched, as if trying to get away from the feathers that adorned his head. They robes didn&#39;t fit, physically or otherwise, but he assumed they would feel more comfortable over time, just as his bow had felt awkward until he had taken it on several hunts. He knew that if he were selected, the tribe&#39;s permission would give him the certainty he needed to fill the outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the other boy donned the garb, and the large robe slipped down his narrow shoulders. But when the first boy looked on his friend smiling and standing tall under the too-large headdress, he saw that this boy wore the cloak and feathers like they were already his. The way he stood, the way he bore them proudly instead of uncertainly, said that he could already see himself as the chief. Perhaps there were skills to be learned, but this boy was not shy of being called chief and being looked to for guidance. Though the garb didn&#39;t fit physically, it seemed to belong to this boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first boy told his friend what he saw and he left the room to tell the elders he was withdrawing. And the little chief who had always been a chief led his tribe on to many great victories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;I’m Moving to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/im-moving-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;Having arrived in Boulder&lt;/a&gt;, I set about trying to establish a life here. Income was (is) hard to come by. I live in a shared apartment, and I&#39;ve applied to a lot of part-time jobs to try to get things started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Live What You Preach: Maintaining Faith in my Move to Boulder&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/live-what-you-preach-maintaining-faith-in-my-move-to-boulder/&#34;&gt;It&#39;s pretty scary sometimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met a guy, not even my age, who goes to work in a suit and tie, who owns his own condo, and who doesn&#39;t just work because he needs a bit of money as he sets up for his next step, but who is a contributing member of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I am quite mature in regards to psychology, emotional intelligence, and personal integrity, but &lt;strong&gt;in terms of my material prosperity, I still envision my life like a student, someone dependent, in transition.</description>

&lt;p&gt;People have a lot of preconceived notions about what they deserve: what they deserve to be called, what they deserve to have, what they deserve to be paid, who they deserve to love and be loved by. We set limits on our own potential, not because we want to hold ourselves back, but rather because we think it is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/why-we-love-the-status-quo/&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;just way&lt;/a&gt;. The thought pattern might go like this: &#34;I&#39;ve only been writing regularly for a few weeks, so I don&#39;t deserve a published novel.&#34; &lt;strong&gt;Ironically, people often are afraid to reach for their goals, because they don&#39;t think they are worthy of them&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</description>
