      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2756&#34; alt=&#34;Swords into Plowshares&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2981939103_1cbae339fb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;407&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;
-Isaiah 2:4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post from Shawn Rhodes, founder of Shoshin Consulting. After growing up in the mountains training in martial arts and eastern philosophy, he followed his own warrior’s calling and joined the U.S. Marines. There, he accompanied infantry Marines through two tours in Iraq, documenting their trials and victories for international news outlets like CNN and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;rhodessmaller&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rhodessmaller-e1358734605767-150x150.jpg&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIME. While living and fighting alongside this tribe of modern-day warriors, he discovered the link between the warrior’s path and mastery in life. He returned to the U.S. with the passion to share a vision of what humans are capable of when they embrace their own inner warrior and return to a mindset where all paths are possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the third in a three-part series on The Warrior&#39;s Path. Each installment will explore the evolution of the warrior mindset. Rooted in ancient methods warriors followed for thousands of years, adopting this mindset can help anyone to regain balance, direction, and control of their health, success, and life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/part-i-of-the-warrior-mindset-turn-problems-into-challenges/&#34;&gt;the first part&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I showed readers how past and present-day warriors learn to shift their mindsets, allowing them to transform the problems they face into challenges of responsibility for the quality of their lives. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-warrior-mindset-part-2-transform-challenges-into-opportunities/&#34;&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;, readers stepped into the mindset of a mature and experienced warrior, a person who is confident in their abilities and no longer feels the need to prove themselves. As a result of this mindset, they see experiences in their lives as opportunities for growth as warriors and human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the next stage in a warrior’s development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, it would be helpful to examine the roles that warriors throughout history have played when they - as a culture - existed in peacetime. It makes sense that skillful warriors would eventually work themselves out of a job by either death or victory. However, the warrior tradition in human cultures has grown to allow for periods of peace. In fact, some of the most skilled warrior societies were based on achieving internal and external peace. Japanese culture, for instance, gave rise to the renowned Samurai.  The word for ‘warrior’ - &lt;i&gt;bushi  &lt;/i&gt;(武士) &lt;i&gt;– &lt;/i&gt;is comprised of symbols for ‘a spear being removed or taken away.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few warriors who experienced and fought in prolonged combat who would choose that lifestyle for themselves and their families. It is a paradox that to achieve peace one must confront war (internally, externally, or both), but it is true. &lt;b&gt;A warriors’ ultimate objective is to bring peace to themselves and their world&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a warrior finds a place of peace, their real challenge begins.</description>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Afford to be Attached to Your Health, So Make it About Others</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-2405&#34; title=&#34;A Helping Hand&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2993512484_4e2bdb7aa5_o-e1347370123178-300x223.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;223&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some people choose not to donate their services because they believe that it somehow devalues them by &#34;giving them away.&#34; In truth, there is nothing that demonstrates the value of your skills more than putting them to good use for a cause you believe in. - Scott Allen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in good shape can be dangerous. It can be very easy to slip into feelings of superiority: “I’m stronger than others. I take better care of myself. I look sexier than most people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is the worst thing in the world, but when I caught myself sneaking too many glances in the mirror and comparing myself to others at my gym, I started to feel that perhaps my &lt;a title=&#34;Fitness is Not Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/fitness-is-not-health/&#34;&gt;priorities&lt;/a&gt; were out of line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, when I was particularly annoyed with my pride, I remembered the story of the Siddhartha Guatama. Siddhartha was a prince who grew up sheltered from suffering but who one day witnessed sickness and death and realized that all his princely luxury, his youth, and his health would fall away. He began to question whether all that he had would truly spare him from suffering or make the world a better place. He gave it all away to seek spiritual enlightenment, eventually achieving &lt;em&gt;nirvana&lt;/em&gt; as the historical Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I realized that, proud as I am of my strong, attractive body, it will one day succumb to death&lt;/strong&gt;. At best, I would remain strong and vital until my twilight years, free of chronic disease, then die suddenly and peacefully. As a believer in the &lt;a title=&#34;The Optimism of Ancestral Health&#34; href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/the-optimism-of-ancestral-health/&#34;&gt;inherent integrity&lt;/a&gt; of the human body, I see this as a distinct possibility. At worst, I’ll succumb to the diseases of aging, watch my strength wither away, and suffer a long, slow decline. &lt;strong&gt;No matter what, I end up being totally useless and utterly repulsive: dead and rotting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of my sense of self-worth was attached to something as impermanent as my health or appearance, my pride was clearly ill-founded. &lt;strong&gt;These things will disappear, so my self-worth and happiness will suffer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body, strength, youth, and vitality I worked so hard to attain will inevitably one day fall away from me. In full acceptance of that truth, I had to find a compelling reason to take care of my health regardless.</description>

      <title>Service with a Smile</title>

This set of images describes several subjects including Traffic Officers on the network, in their TO vehicles, helping to the public and working at Regional Control Centre.&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/servesmile-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say kids these days seem to have a sense of entitlement. Since ‘they’ were referring to ‘kids’ my age (aka, me) I tended to disagree with this statement. Apparently a lot of kids my age are turning down low-level service oriented jobs because we think we are above that sort of work. I tell myself I am endowed with good old fashioned values, can exercise self-discipline, and am not afraid to get my hands dirty. I can do menial tasks well and cheerfully, glad at the opportunity to be a part of something, even if just a small part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, I LOVE helping other people! I live to serve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my dad asked me to help him take the car in for service.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.” -Napoleon Hill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much about the Warrior Spirit is centered around independence and self-sufficiency. I talk a lot about the need to stick to our own convictions and believe in our own dreams. There is a lot of standing up against the tide of mediocrity that tries to bring us back into the fold, a lot of fighting for our best lives and the life we want. So it may come as a bit of a shock when I say that a true Warrior is not complete if he only pursues his own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the purpose of developing the self is so that you can serve others better.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Warrior: Service</title>
      <link>https://khaledallen.github.io/archive/traits-of-a-warrior-service/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, Warriors have been the guardians of their societies. They do not train and fight for the sake of it, or for senseless violence. Historical warriors have learned the arts of war in order to better protect their people and families, or to extend their reach of their chosen sovereign. Tribal warriors were the ones who put their lives on the line to defend their families. Knights and Samurai were the ones willing to die for their lords&#39; agenda.</description>
