&lt;p&gt;“Marmalade in the morning has the same effect on taste buds that a cold shower has on the body.” Jeanine Larmoth (I have no idea what that implies, but it was the only reasonably insightful quotation I could find on cold showers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I discovered that I cannot fall asleep unless I take a cold shower before bed. This seems to cool my system off and trigger an internal warming mechanism that makes me really cozy and helps me fall asleep.</description>

      <title>Conserving Water, Water Everywhere</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/whale.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-636&#34; title=&#34;whale&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/whale.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;195&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I recently saw the new remake of &lt;em&gt;Karate Kid,&lt;/em&gt; starring Jared Smith and Jackie Chan. Overall, it was a great movie, full of inspiring struggles to overcome adversity and useful advice about growing up and facing challenges. It also made an interesting comment on consumption patterns. And there were some awesome Kung Fu sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, in China, you must flip a switch to start preparing for a hot shower. The switch heats up the water, and when you&#39;re done taking your shower, you turn it off. It saves money and electricity, for obvious reasons. Jared&#39;s character doesn&#39;t understand this and asks, &#34;Why not just keep it on?&#34; Jackie Chan is surprised and appalled to discover that in America, we don&#39;t even have a switch. We just keep the hot water on all the time! He leaves Jared with this bit of advice: &#34;Get switch. Save money. Save the planet.&#34;</description>
