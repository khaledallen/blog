      <description>The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, Stick-to-itiveness, and Common sense. - Thomas Edison
 No matter how determined you are in weightlifting or any sport, there are limits to your strength that are determined by your training. If you&#39;re a beginning lifter, it doesn&#39;t matter how badly you want it, you&#39;re not lifting 500lbs.
No matter how badly you want something or how hard you&#39;re willing to try, you can&#39;t get by on passion and verve alone.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1640&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; caption=&#34;Daisyree Bakker on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/27875041@N02/4425848358/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1640&#34; title=&#34;bear&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bear-199x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;199&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™d rather train to outrun a bear than to fight one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am more likely to actually attain my goal of outrunning a  bear, and will be able to apply that skill in a variety of  environments. If there are trees, I can climb them. If there is water, I  can swim. Climbing cliffs and rocks is another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, however, I simply train to be massively strong in  hopes of eventually overpowering the bear, I am starting at a distinct  disadvantage. Additionally, if I do face the bear in a fight, even if I  win (which is extremely unlikely), I am much more likely to get injured.</description>
