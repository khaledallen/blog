&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of criticism for my failed attempt at starting a t-shirt design company. We had one run of t-shirts, I didn&#39;t sell all of them, and my income was so low I couldn&#39;t even cover the cost of the website hosting. I lost a lot of money, too. Some might think this is strong evidence that I shouldn&#39;t go into business, since I couldn&#39;t make even a small project work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have told the naysayers that I intend to try again. The usual response is a look of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot by failing, and I want to try applying the lessons to another project and see if I can make something else work. Isn&#39;t that the whole point of learning? &lt;strong&gt;Make the failure worth something by learning from it.</description>
