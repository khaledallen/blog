&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last week helping my family move our home, which is partly why I&#39;ve been remiss in posting for so long. We are downsizing because the kids are out of the nest (even though I still live at home and my sister just moved back after college. Go figure). My parents are trying to save space and money, but doing so required us to come to grips with the fact that we have tons of stuff, massive quantities of things we didn&#39;t even remember we owned, from all over the world, much of it outdated and unusable.</description>
