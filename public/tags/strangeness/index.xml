      <title>You&#39;ve Got to Be A Little Crazy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered how great things get accomplished in this world. It&#39;s so hard to get past the day-to-day of basic social niceties, the need to make a living, following current fashion trends, and doing what&#39;s expected of you. How does anyone have time to do anything else? Where do you find the time to redefine a field when most modern fields require all your time just to stay current? How do you become all that you can be when being the bare minimum is a full time job?</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have come to the realization that I am a weird dude.  Furthermore, I have finally accepted that I am one of the weirdest  people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I was holding out that I just had a few  eccentricities related to my exercise and dietary habits. After a while,  though, these things started to impact other areas of my life, and the  weirdness started to grow. An interest in barefoot running turned into a  general refusal to wear shoes. A concern with healthy food led to  eating raw meat. It became very hard to deny that Iâ€™m just strange.</description>
