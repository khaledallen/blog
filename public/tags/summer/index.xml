&lt;p&gt;We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have to share the same box -&lt;em&gt;Anon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of my childhood at a wonderful summer camp in Northern Minnesota, where it seemed like everyone was a potential friend and all the friends you made were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/best-friends-for-life/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;true friends&lt;/a&gt;. How great would that be in real life? So often the friends we make have agendas, or only hang around us at certain times and with certain people. There is often a sense of insincerity, or somewhat impure friendship. But at Summer Camp, the friends you made at horseback riding were just as good for sailing (assuming they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; sail), and you could eat with them, camp with them, play games with them, or just sit and watch the lake together. There is a strange and wondrous ease about camp friends that is so rare and hard to find elsewhere.</description>
