&lt;p&gt;We all dream of becoming something more than we are, of surpassing the everyday. We have an urge to outgrow ourselves: be more healthy, more wealthy, more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we act on that, and sometimes we don&#39;t, but it&#39;s always there, tickling at the back of our minds. &#34;How wonderful it would be to transcend my limitations?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, one of the most chafing limitations has always been where I can go and what my body is capable of. Whenever I watch movies or even cartoons about exceptional warriors, martial artists, and heroes, I am always surprised by how I feel seeing those fancy moves. &lt;strong&gt;It&#39;s not awe so much as jealousy, a sense that, not only do I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be able to do that, I believe that I &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be able to&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I have to keep in mind that most of these shows and stories are fiction, and most of the moves are performed by stunt doubles with the aid of special effects. But there are exceptional humans out there who are not always Olympic or world champion level: club gymnasts, strongmen and women, marathoners and ultra-runners, powerlifters, traceurs, rocks climbers, dancers, athletes, Shaolin monks, stuntmen. Anyone from any walk of life can become accomplished in any of these feats that transcend what we consider normal for a human being. They may not break any world records, but a 2x bodyweight deadlift is a significant achievement, and puts you in the top range of (modern, industrialized) humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But maybe it&#39;s not about becoming something more than what we are. Maybe it&#39;s about expressing what we already have within us.</description>

      <title>Warrior Profile: Comparing Batman and Spiderman</title>

      <description>I talk a lot about Batman as an inspiration for training and following ideals, so just for fun, I thought I&#39;d write a post on how exactly the Path of the Warrior can be discerned from his life. To make things more interesting, I will be comparing him to another popular superhero: Spiderman. I picked these two because a) they are very nearly opposites without one being a villain, and b) there were recently made several movies about each.</description>
