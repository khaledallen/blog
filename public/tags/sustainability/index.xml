      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/omnivore.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-1799&#34; title=&#34;omnivore&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/omnivore.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;194&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of all the animals in the world, certainly we have the widest selection of possible foods; we can eat meat, vegetables, grains, legumes, dairy, and even industrial chemicals (apparently). And yet while a squirrel can look at an acorn and know instinctively that it is good to eat, we have to consider our food options. With so much variety, the only way we know what is good to eat and what isn’t is through trial and error, cultural norms, and our sense of taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the omnivore’s dilemma, and it forms the basis for the book by Michael Pollan, which explores how we modern humans produce, acquire, and prepare our food.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Traffic has been especially bad lately. As I worked my way through New York traffic the other day, I was astounded at how many miles of road there are and that every single one is choked with traffic. There are just so many cars on the road. It is worrying to me knowing all the resources that not only went into producing those cars, but also go into keeping them running every single day. It’s not that there are a lot of cars. There is an incomprehensible number. As far as the eye can see, nothing but smog-spewing vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this be sustainable?</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It is the observation here that our cause is the cause of all mankind, and that we are fighting for their liberty in defending our own” - Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, societies have always gone through cycles of establishment and revolution. The established order, originally meant as liberating, starts to become oppressive in its attempts to institutionalize itself. In turn, revolutionaries rise to oppose the system, to assert individuality and reinstate the balance. Sometimes they fail, sometimes they are incorporated into the existing order, and sometimes they overthrow the current order and establish their own system. We are at a time of revolution, though it is a quiet one.</description>
