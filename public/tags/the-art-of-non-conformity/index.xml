&lt;p&gt;Why jump off the bridge just because everyone else is doing it? You can step back from the bridge, turn around, and walk away into new adventures that had previously been only fleeting ideas. You can also help other people walk away from the bridge, or you can rewrite the rules the brought to the bridge in the first place. The possibilities are unlimited, but it all begins with the deliberate decision to think differently - Chris Guillebeau., &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I did a book review, as I&#39;ve been reading several books at once. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve finally managed to finish one, by fellow blogger and inspiration Chris Guillebeau of &lt;a href=&#34;http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;. Chris is a self-described traveler and writer. He pays the bills by writing (which he can do from anywhere), and spends as much time as possible travelling the world with the ultimate goal of visiting every country. His book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity,&lt;/em&gt; provides readers with a glimpse of his unorthodox worldviews which, he maintains, are much more empowering and liberating than the traditional worldview we are taught to follow.</description>
