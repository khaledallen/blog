      <description>What does heroism mean to you?
For some people, heroism is about showing up for their families. Maybe you make a comfortable income, but getting home late and never having the chance to tuckÂ your kids into bed makes you feel empty and hollow.
For others, it&#39;s the other way around: you take care of the home and family, but you want to have a bigger impact in the wider community.</description>
