&lt;p&gt;“There are people who put their dreams in a little box and say, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve got dreams, of course I&#39;ve got dreams.&#34; Then they put the box away and bring it out once in awhile to look in it, and yep, they&#39;re still there.” -Emma Bombeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little kid, I was taught that I could not support myself doing something fun that I loved. I would have to find a job that tediously &#39;contributed&#39; to society in order to make enough money so I&#39;d have the resources to spend my free time engaged in enjoyable &#39;hobbies&#39;. Life would always be a trade off between doing what you had to, based on what someone else deemed was a valuable use of your time, and doing what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve begun to question the assumption that doing something you enjoy is a poor way to make money. Of course, if you&#39;re really lucky, you&#39;ll end up in a job you love, so money-making will be bearable, but the emphasis was on fitting yourself into a job, rather than the other way around.</description>
