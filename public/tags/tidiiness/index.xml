&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you&#39;ve got to let everything go - purge yourself. If you are unhappy with anything . . . whatever is bringing you down, get rid of it. Because you&#39;ll find that when you&#39;re free, your true creativity, your true self comes out.” - Tina Turner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity! The word rings of freedom, personal fulfillment, making a difference. It is how we contribute to the world around us and &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; new realities out of our ideas. Most of us were very creative when we were young. When I was younger, I was immensely creative. I would write short stories daily. I was constantly drawing things on my school papers, and I filled up several sketchbooks. I even wrote poetry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought that my creativity was the result of a messy, hectic life, but my life got a lot messier in college, right about the time my creativity disappeared.</description>
