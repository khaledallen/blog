Something about our natures necessitates living in filth and squalor, much to the chagrin of our parents, forced to visit and stay on our couch (unless they can afford a motel) or play host yet again as we struggle to find a job. The weird thing is, for a lot of us, we were actually pretty tidy back in the day. But now that we have our own place, why bother cleaning up? After all, I know exactly where my nice shirt is, even if that changes from day to day. It&#39;s not like our messy living spaces are unhygienic. A little inconvenient maybe, but it takes just as much time to clean and tidy as it does to search out our favorite pair of jeans.</description>
