      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; was first released, I was so excited to read about quick, easily applied shortcuts to &#39;improve&#39; my life and my body. How could I resist the promise of becoming superhuman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I tried to apply the habits, none of them stuck. It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t work, but they were hacks, not part of a cohesive lifestyle, and hacks are not meant to be permanent or sustainable. The &lt;em&gt;4-Hour Body&lt;/em&gt; in particular reads like a recipe book: you pick your abilities, like building a character in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Lifehacking applied to people, and while the allure was irresistible, it felt hollow.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be” -George Sheehan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a series three books on how to change the world, how to give as much as possible to your community, and how to help others get the things they need. The first was a book on how to become wealthy, the second was a book about becoming indispensable to your company, and the third was simply a book about selling. Yes, these were business books, but not business books in the way I usually think about the genre.</description>
