      <description>I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m qualified to define a morality for all young people, or even why I care so much. I figure it&#39;s as much for myself as for others. I don&#39;t know why it gets harder to achieve your potential after childhood, how to balance pragmatism and idealism, when high standards bleed into obsessive perfectionism. I don&#39;t know if anything I say applies to girls, or why more girls comment on what I write even though the image of a warrior is masculine to me.</description>
