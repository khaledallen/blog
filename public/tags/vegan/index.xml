&lt;p&gt;Eating differently is hard. It&#39;s like being a Yankee fan in Boston, except suddenly everywhere is Boston. There is no real reason why everyone else decides you&#39;re messed up and not worth talking to. They do it simply on principle. So when someone decides to eat differently, they are signing up for being the perpetual oddball, the person you&#39;d think twice about inviting to a party just because feeding them will be so annoyingly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except Anna is definitely not the kind of person you&#39;d think twice about inviting to a party. Anna is the kind of person you&#39;d build the invite list around. And Anna is a vegan, the most extreme and obnoxiously complicated type of person to feed (I know because my sister was one).</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;You scream, I scream, we all scream for ice cream!&#34; - American Proverb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice cream is probably the greatest food ever invented by humankind. But it is also probably one of the least healthy. It is basically milk and sugar, plus any flavorings and toppings. Of course, ice cream isn&#39;t meant to be healthy, so it should be an occasional treat, but sometimes you just have a craving for it when you know you can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t break out the scoop and fudge sauce.</description>
