      <description>Some books change our lives. Daring Greatly was that kind of book for me. In the midst of an internal crisis this summer, I came across this book by Brene Brown, renowned researcher and author on vulnerability, courage, worthiness, and shame.
One of Brown&#39;s key points is that, in order to do great things, we have to embrace vulnerability. That feeling of exposing yourself is scary, but it&#39;s necessary because only by really reaching outside our comfort zones, by risking real pain or loss, can we achieve something really worth striving for.</description>

      <title>The Tender-hearted Warrior</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world. You are willing to share your heart with others.” - Chogyam Trungpa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chogyam Trungpa said one of the defining traits of the spiritual warrior is a raw, vulnerable heart open to both the beautiful and the tragic. The main character in Dan Millman&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Peaceful Warrior &lt;/em&gt;also learns the importance of allowing himself to open up his heart to both love and grieve when a friend&#39;s house burns down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Warrior Spirit is not characterized by a stony heart and ultimate pragmatism. It includes--even requires--a sensitive heart that can be inspired to action to protect the wonderful things in the world and to oppose the evil ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior Spirit has a heart so sensitive, &#34;even if a tiny little mosquito lands on it, you feel touched.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! This seems like a liability for us who commit ourselves to taking on the big challenges in the world and our lives. How can we hope to stand up to the manipulations of those with no moral limitations if we are so affected by our own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;strong&gt;the reason there is such suffering and fear in the world is because we hardened our hearts in order to survive the disappointments and hardships of the world&lt;/strong&gt;. By cutting those things out, we also lost our ability to truly appreciate beauty and wonder and we entered into a cycle of emotional defensiveness: we hide in our comfortable houses that keep out the world, we get to work in protective luxury cars that keep out the noise of the street, we isolate ourselves from the suffering of others so we can pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, but we also never understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand everything is to forgive everything. - Buddha</description>
