      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3930&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smallfishbiggoal-e1423078046392.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;smallfishbiggoal&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; /&gt;I woke up this morning and looked out on a winter wonderland. Snow had been coming down all night, and it was falling in tiny biting crystals that stuck to everything. Very pretty, very cold, and very wet. The sidewalks were covered in snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;I guess I&#39;m not going for my morning run,&#34; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I stopped myself and asked a different question: &#34;&lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; I go for my morning run, in shorts and a shirt as usual?&#34; I&#39;d run in cold weather before, but not in actual falling snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn&#39;t know the answer to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided not to make assumptions about my limitations and just give it a shot. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be so bad.</description>
