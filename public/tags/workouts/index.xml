&lt;p&gt;As a CrossFit trainer, I sometimes feel like I&#39;m not allowed to use, much less espouse, alternative forms of physical training or diet. But since I&#39;ve been caught so many times doing very un-CrossFit-like things, and a lot of people ask me what my training program is, or what my diet is, I thought I&#39;d come clean.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned as a Trainer and Athlete</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a personal trainer now for about two years, and I&#39;ve been actively training myself for about three. It has been quite a journey, and I&#39;ve come a long way. When I started, I could only dream of doing a pull up. Now it is my strongest movement. Handstands were so far beyond my abilities as to be pure fantasy, and now I spend a lot of time inverted. I&#39;ve travelled a long road in a short amount of time, and I&#39;ve learned a few lessons along the way that I thought I would share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_1354&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; caption=&#34;John Pavelka on Flickr&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/28705377@N04/4355106020/sizes/m/in/photostream/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1354&#34; title=&#34;Sunbathing&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rest-300x229.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;229&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&#39;ve been able to commit myself to a more minimalist approach to training. As an multi-sport athlete, I&#39;ve always found it difficult to focus my training on one or two things. Instead, I&#39;ve found myself always jumping around, never giving enough time to any particular method to make much headway. Alternatively, I&#39;ve toyed with trying to do everything all the time, and quickly burned myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, by limiting the time I can train, I am finding myself more motivated to give a good effort in the less time that I do train. &lt;strong&gt;When there is less to do, and less time to do it in, you will push yourself to make the most of what time you do have&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

      <title>Would You Rather Weigh Less, or Feel Better?</title>

&lt;p&gt;For many people, the answer to that question is actually that they would rather weigh less. For many women especially, weight is the end-all-be-all of the larger world of health. You can be fit as a fiddle, but if you weight “too much” it doesn’t matter a bit.</description>

      <title>An Odd Duck: My Stranger Health Habits</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the name of health, I engage in some practices that others find pretty weird. I actually don&#39;t find them that odd, and they aren&#39;t really inconvenient to me. I actually really enjoy them. But since they aren&#39;t mainstream, they garner some odd looks. I thought I&#39;d list some of them for your entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little rebellion now and then... is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.”- Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/healthy-living-join-the-health-_b_799191.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;claiming that being healthy is a revolutionary act, a difficult process that necessitates you make choices that put you in opposition to the mainstream and the social norm. To be healthy requires you be willing to ostracise yourself in the name of your own well-being because the sad truth is that our society has made poor health the trend and the norm.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.” - George-Louis Leclerc de Buffon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have had a lot of waiting to do as my plans start to gain momentum. There are long periods during which nothing seems to bear any fruit. Farm to Table went silent for a long time, with almost no new comments or community engagement, leading me to get very discouraged. I was lacking motivation in my workouts and didn&#39;t really feel like I was making any progress. My blog seemed to be wallowing in obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of sudden things started to move very quickly, and I realized that it was the quiet times when things were starting to move towards a tipping point. I am getting a lot of people reaching out to connect over Farm to Table, there is a new energy in my training, and I am making all sorts of friends while reconnecting with old ones. It&#39;s almost more than I can handle.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We all have times in our lives when we find ourselves unable to do the things we love, often because we did too much of the things we love. Whether it&#39;s cutting back on delicious pies because we had too many in one sitting last winter or cutting back our training load because we hurt ourselves, we get ourselves into situations that we regret, doing something we knew we shouldn&#39;t have done at the time, but did anyway.</description>

The other Stamford-based CrossFit gym, Hybrid Fitness, believes that extreme strength is pretty much the fundamental requirement for a good athelete. As such, they utilize a lot of strongman programming and training. We do not, and generally we aren&#39;t as strong on average. Does that mean we are worse than them?</description>
