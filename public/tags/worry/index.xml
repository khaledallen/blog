&lt;p&gt;Since finishing the CrossFit sectionals, I’ve been taking a  break from fitness for the last two weeks. Basically I have tried to  relax about fitness and just do what I feel like in terms of exercise  and nutrition. I expected to lose some ground with my training, but I  felt that I was due for a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is I have actually gotten stronger and  faster. I recently ran a few quarter-mile intervals and put up some of  my fastest times ever. My front lever has become so solid I can do  bicycle crunches while holding myself horizontal. Clearly, I just needed  some rest to develop the latent strength. Leading up to sectionals, I  was so uptight about workouts and diet, and I did pretty well, but now  that I’ve stopped worrying so much, I seem to be doing just as well  anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems that I do just as well (or better) not worrying about stuff and I do when I worry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why worry?</description>
