      <title>Anatomy of a WS Blog Post</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;“Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go.” E.L. Doctorow&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/3397858623_ff8e4ce060.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-full wp-image-2445&#34; title=&#34;Anatomy of a Blogger&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3397858623_ff8e4ce060.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;322&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old writing teacher once told me it&#39;s better to be wordy and get the point across than try to cater to short attention spans and leave everyone scratching their heads. I learned in high school that if you write an engaging story, people will read 20 page sci-fi action adventures, long for high school creative writing. If you make it appeal to their emotions, they will even enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing goes for blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a writer with a blog, I want to make sure every post I write is engaging and inspiring. Learning how to write in this medium has been a long and arduous process. I am still refining it, but in recent months, I&#39;ve had a bit of success reaching new readers, so I wanted to share my current working template of my blog posts. Not all of them match this, of course (this one doesn&#39;t), but it serves as a loose framework to aim for.  It largely depends on how much time I have and how much energy I have after chasing &lt;del&gt;psychotic&lt;/del&gt; energetic Korean children around all day.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned on Finishing My First Book</title>

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&#34;attachment_2384&#34; align=&#34;alignright&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/523903_867106689110_2023854343_n.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-2384&#34; title=&#34;The First Printout of the Book&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/523903_867106689110_2023854343_n-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The book hardcopy for proofing[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Writing a book is an adventure. To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement; then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes a master, and then a tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster, and fling him out to the public.” - Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is published, people have downloaded and read it, and there&#39;s even &lt;a title=&#34;Patrick Garner&#39;s Review&#34; href=&#34;http://patrickgarner.tumblr.com/post/30796756323/book-review-warrior-spirit-principles-for-holistic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; out already. It has been better received than I dared imagine, and it marks the accomplishment of a huge step in my quest to overcome a deep-seated, paralyzing introversion; not just writing something long, but having the courage to put it out into the world.</description>

      <title>The Value of Failure</title>

&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of criticism for my failed attempt at starting a t-shirt design company. We had one run of t-shirts, I didn&#39;t sell all of them, and my income was so low I couldn&#39;t even cover the cost of the website hosting. I lost a lot of money, too. Some might think this is strong evidence that I shouldn&#39;t go into business, since I couldn&#39;t make even a small project work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have told the naysayers that I intend to try again. The usual response is a look of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot by failing, and I want to try applying the lessons to another project and see if I can make something else work. Isn&#39;t that the whole point of learning? &lt;strong&gt;Make the failure worth something by learning from it.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m No Expert...And I Don&#39;t Want to Be</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I started this blog, I had no aspirations to do  anything more than share my thoughts about life and the world. I figured some of the things I was going through might be  interesting to others, mainly my family. I didn’t really set out to tell  anyone how to live their life or even provide advice. I was just  sharing my experience of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This differs markedly from how blogs are getting used these days as a platform to establish the author as an expert with no other credentials besides the blog itself.</description>

      <title>Can I Preach It, if I Don&#39;t Live It?</title>

&lt;p&gt;It would be too easy to be perfect all the time. It is  far more difficult to accept that you’re not perfect but to believe  that you have worthwhile things to say despite that, and to say those  things with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last two weeks, I’d been in a bit of a rut.  Things that used to excite me didn’t appeal to me anymore. Exercise,  gymnastics, trail running, and even writing all seemed tedious and  boring. All I wanted to do all day was go home and sleep, and when I got  home, I didn’t want to sleep. I was just generally out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also seemed to be messing up everything good in my life.  Professionally, I’d given up a lot of hours training to work on my  writing, with the result that I was pretty broke. My  iPad-as-laptop-replacement experiment was a failure, so I had to buy a  new laptop. My relationship with my girlfriend was in a rough patch,  which just makes everything else seems hellish. I wasn’t sleeping well,  and all I wanted to eat was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which  was a problem because I don’t keep jelly at my house and most bread  gives me indigestion. My room was a mess, and I was out of clean  underwear and floss (surprisingly discouraging, actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to say that things have improved, though I still  need to invest in some floss, but I wanted to talk a little bit about  the weirdness of being an inspirational writer and not always feeling  inspired.</description>

      <title>What It Means to be a Writer</title>

&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little boy, I&#39;ve wanted to be a writer. Back then, that meant I got to spend all day writing stories, which was something I loved doing. I couldn&#39;t imagine a better way to spend my time than telling stories about dragons and spaceships. Since that&#39;s what writers did, I wanted to be a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Warrior Spirit</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to inject a little more of me into my posts. After all, this blog was started by me as a sort of online journal. I was reluctant to assume that all my readers found my life all that interesting, but I thought I&#39;d just write about it. I am a storyteller, after all, not just an essayist. Since the story I know best is my own, I wanted to tell that story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, I got swept up by all these other great blogs that also tell stories, but which also provide lots of useful information besides. Somehow, the information stuck out more than the stories, and I focused on that. As a result, I feel that Warrior Spirit has kind of drifted from being personal to trying too hard to be useful. The result I think has been less connection with my readers. The blog has grown and grown, and for that I&#39;m thankful, but I feel a little like I&#39;ve sold out (except without the monetary rewards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;m going to try to tell more of my stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving Up the Nonessential</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the last week, I&#39;ve sold my laptop and replaced it with an Apple iPad 2. This leaves me without a regular computer capable of such basic functions as running flash programs, storing more than a few hours of music and video, and playing the most interesting games out there. Instead, I&#39;ve got myself a tiny, super light tablet about 10&#34; large that I can take anywhere. And, even more important, I have no distractions anymore.&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>&#34;Are you a Writer?&#34;</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Every human being has hundreds of separate people living under his skin. The talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living with him.” - Mel Brooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was standing on the train platform on my way into New York when a young girl standing with her mother looked over and asked me, &#34;Are you a writer?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been asked this before. Normally, if people see me carrying my journal, they ask if I write, but not if I am myself a &#39;writer&#39;. But this girl thought I looked like a writer, with my long hair, unshaven beard, and worn leather jacket. Or maybe it was the classically creative look of my Moleskine journal (thank you Moleskine, I will never make fun of your pretentiousness again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question left me speechless for a moment. I was almost suspicious, as if the girl had asked me, &#34;Would you like an extra $500?&#34; The first thing you want is to say yes, but it just seems too easy.</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.” - George-Louis Leclerc de Buffon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have had a lot of waiting to do as my plans start to gain momentum. There are long periods during which nothing seems to bear any fruit. Farm to Table went silent for a long time, with almost no new comments or community engagement, leading me to get very discouraged. I was lacking motivation in my workouts and didn&#39;t really feel like I was making any progress. My blog seemed to be wallowing in obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of sudden things started to move very quickly, and I realized that it was the quiet times when things were starting to move towards a tipping point. I am getting a lot of people reaching out to connect over Farm to Table, there is a new energy in my training, and I am making all sorts of friends while reconnecting with old ones. It&#39;s almost more than I can handle.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&#34;Blogging is not rocket science, it’s about being yourself, and putting what you have into it.&#34; -Unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is both a wonderful and a frustrating experience for a writer. On the one hand, it gives you the opportunity to put your ideas out there with no publishing costs and the freedom to write whatever you want. On the other hand, it leaves all the publicity up to you. It&#39;s like a journal that people might actually care about and read, and it creates the possibility of a self-crafted audience. I&#39;ve come a long way as a blogger, but I still find that I have a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;_mcePaste&#34;&gt;If while washing dishes, we think only of the cup of tea that awaits us, thus hurrying to get the dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance, then we are not &#34;washing the dishes to wash the dishes.&#34; What&#39;s more, we are not alive during the time we are washing the dishes.... While drinking the cup of tea, we will only be thinking of other things, barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are sucked away into the future -and we are incapable of actually living one minute of life. - Naht Hahn, &lt;em&gt;Miracle of Mindfulness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern technology is a wonderful thing. It gives us access to more information than we could possibly ever hope to read and understand. It connects us to people all over the world and lets us share ideas and conversations with them on a whim. It puts the entirety of human knowledge at our fingertips. As a college student, I was infinitely grateful for the fact that I could do almost all my research and class readings online without having to spend hours in the bookstacks looking for texts. At the click of a button, I could bring to my attention the latest psychological research and in the same breath skim an article on current events.&lt;/p&gt;

People know this about me, and my parents have long encouraged the habit. As a result, I used to get a lot of writing-themed books as gifts. One particular type of book always made me feel inadequate as a writer: speciality dictionaries, full of strange and esoteric words (even more esoteric than &#39;esoteric&#39;) that a well-educated shaper of the English language ought to master and use in everyday speech. The problem was, I didn&#39;t really care to learn all these new words. So the books sat on my shelf, collecting dust, because I kept telling myself that, one day, I&#39;d get around to memorizing all these new, important words and incorporating them into my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m glad I never did.</description>

      <title>How I Find Time to Write</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://khaledallen.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/typewriter.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-516&#34; title=&#34;Old typewriter help&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/typewriter.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I know that lately, I haven&#39;t been posting as regularly as  I used to. I&#39;ve felt the consequences. My readership has declined, and I feel like my writing style has gotten a little stiff from lack of flexing. Writing has always been a hugely important part of my life. Not only is it an artistic means to express myself, it has always been associated with periods of balance in my life; when I&#39;m writing regularly, my mind and spirit are in order, and a lot of other things as well. When I can&#39;t find the time to write, things slowly come apart at the seams. I don&#39;t really know why this is. Perhaps writing is how I parse my jumbled thoughts into discrete, comprehensible units called words and sentences, which I can then manipulate and act on in my life. Without taking the time to do this, my thoughts and ideas just fill to the brim and overflow in a messy jumble of psychic disorder. Writing is a form of meditation, a kind of waking dreaming for me.</description>

      <title>Intellectual Honesty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since starting this blog, I have constantly run into the problem of how honest to be with my readers. My parents are constantly asking me to tone down certain things, to refrain from sharing personal details of my life I think are important to understanding my thought process. I don&#39;t really know where to draw the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation the other day with a friend who works in advertising. She is very supportive of my blogging, and every time I come up with an interesting idea, she encourages me to blog it, to share it with the world. My latest idea was somewhat risque, to put it lightly, but she said that was precisely the point. By being open and honeset about the truth of my life, I would be able to achieve a degree of integrity in my intellectual and emotional life that had eluded me.</description>
