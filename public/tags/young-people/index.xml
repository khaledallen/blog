Something about our natures necessitates living in filth and squalor, much to the chagrin of our parents, forced to visit and stay on our couch (unless they can afford a motel) or play host yet again as we struggle to find a job. The weird thing is, for a lot of us, we were actually pretty tidy back in the day. But now that we have our own place, why bother cleaning up? After all, I know exactly where my nice shirt is, even if that changes from day to day. It&#39;s not like our messy living spaces are unhygienic. A little inconvenient maybe, but it takes just as much time to clean and tidy as it does to search out our favorite pair of jeans.</description>

We get to spend the next four years discovering our interests academically, finding our social niche, and figuring out our professional futures so that when we graduate...we still have no idea what we want to do with our lives. The problem is multi-faceted, but hinges on the fact that college is not a reflection of the real world. The subjects are not applied as they would be, the social life is completely unique, and the reward system does not reflect how people find fulfillment outside of college. Furthermore, there is a lot of pressure in college to do what is best for our academic or professional future, and too often the focus is on short term requirements to meet various grant or internship criteria, not personal happiness.</description>
