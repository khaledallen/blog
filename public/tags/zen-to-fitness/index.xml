      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.khaledallen.com/warriorspirit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/simpleguide.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-1209&#34; title=&#34;simpleguide&#34; src=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/simpleguide-237x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;237&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a review of an e-book by a fellow blogger that I&#39;ve followed for years. His blog, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://zentofitness.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zen to Fitness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; is inspired by the idea that health and vitality should not be a struggle. I am not an affiliate marketer for his book; this review is simply me sharing insights on an interesting book I read by a blogger who has inspired my own fitness pursuits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a great deal of time learning about and exploring many different kinds of diets, I’ve come across a lot of overly complicated explanations of how to eat healthy. Everyone seems to think their way is best, but I’ve found that the basic principles of diets that actually work are always the same: eat meals balanced in proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, made from fresh, high quality ingredients. Avoid too much sugar, and enjoy your food, eating when you’re hungry until you’re full. Whether it’s Paleo, Primal, Zone, Locavore, Vegtarian, Vegan, or Traditional, these principles always seem to hold. Of course, exponents of each diet focus on what makes them different, and this just leads to confusion. Vegans will tell you that eating meat leads to bodily decay, while the Paleo crowd will tell you that not eating meat leads to decrepitude.</description>
